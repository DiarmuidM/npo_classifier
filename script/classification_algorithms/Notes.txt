Use Lemmatizer or other stemmer: In Naive-Bayes
Reason: The words are not using Word2Vec technique to vectoroze
The method will normalize words

In NN: Use words Embedding
No need to use lemmatizer or stemmer in NN, as Embedder does the job

NN Baseline:
Word Embedding and 1 layer

level 1: Word embedding and multiple layers

#Sampling condition:
Each category should have at-least 100 records each
Apply the same condition

Implement CNN- non-static, Yoo Kim, Based to TREC
• CNN-static: A model with pre-trained
vectors from word2vec. All words—
including the unknown ones that are randomly initialized—are kept static and only
the other parameters of the model are learned.
• CNN-non-static: Same as above but the pretrained vectors are fine-tuned for each task.

Notes from Suyog (PhD passout from UT Austin):
for NLP: Make sure that the layers are fine-tuned
In case of overfitting: Reduce the number of layers used
What they use for NLP: RNN, LSTM
Activation: Sigmoid & tanh
Try: Gensem for sentence level embedding: use it for XGBoost or Random Forest
Try: Don't fine-tune embedding layers, keep the finetuning parameter off

optimizers: try 'adam' over 'rmsprop'
