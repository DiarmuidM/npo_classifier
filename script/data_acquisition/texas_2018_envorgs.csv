KPC also monitors its conservation easement lands on an annual basis to ensure that the goals and objectives of the legal agreement between KPC and the impacted landowner are followed and the land in question remains viable for its conservation values. KPC is working to establish more vigorous baseline data on all its preserves and to tract changes over time through regular monitoring protocols.Land Management and Restoration - During 2004-2005, KPC's Board of Directors approved securing a majority ownership of the historic Warren Ranch, a working cattle ranch. The Board determined that the continued operations of the Warren Ranch were part of KPC's mission to protect the unique scenic, historic and natural sites on the Katy Prairie. They noted that well-managed farmland shelters wildlife, supplies scenic open space, and helps filter impurities from our air and water and that these agricultural lands offer many other benefits as well: preservation of open space and natural resources; outdoor recreation, including bird watching, hiking, hunting, and nature tours; improved flood protection; economic development through eco-tourism; enhanced wildlife habitat; recharge zones for the area's aquifers; educational field trips for area youth, and research opportunities for colleges and universities in ecology and land management. The prairie also provides children who might not otherwise have an opportunity to visit a working ranch to ride a horse or tour a farm to see how food is produced - a distinctive outdoor experience.","Long-term goals are to: protect 50,000 acres; allow public access; ensure responsible stewardship of protected lands; restore and enhance wildlife habitat; offer educational programs; and conduct and facilitate appropriate research to accomplish KPCs mission.","Land Conservation - The Katy Prairie Conservancy (KPC) protects land on the Katy Prairie in the following ways: acquisition of conservation lands at fair market value, acquisition of conservation lands through a bargain sale arrangement, receipt of donated conservation lands to KPC, receipt of donated trade lands to KPC, donation of conservation easements to KPC, and purchase of development rights on conservation lands on the Katy Prairie. Conservation lands are held in permanent trust and are maintained for the benefit of both the wildlife that inhabit the lands and the public who enjoy visiting KPC's preserves.##Preserve Enhancement - KPC has developed general management plans for all its protected properties that ensure that the lands are not further degraded by invasive species (including Chinese Tallow, McCartney Rose, feral hogs and other feral animals) and are maintained in their traditional uses. More detailed management plans are prepared for properties as KPC undertakes preserve enhancement and restoration activities, including the restoration and creation of wetlands and the enhancement and replanting of native grasslands.##Community Education and Outreach - KPC offered more than 100 events, tours, and programs to enable the public to enjoy different aspects of the Katy Prairie, including its bi-monthly Unplugged Adventures (special activities at KPC's preserves), guided tours, and training for current and prospective volunteers. In addition KPC also hosts small group tours (working in cooperation with other conservation entities and area naturalists) as well as field trips for young people.

KPC also monitors its conservation easement lands on an annual basis to ensure that the goals and objectives of the legal agreement between KPC and the impacted landowner are followed and the land in question remains viable for its conservation values. KPC is working to establish more vigorous baseline data on all its preserves and to tract changes over time through regular monitoring protocols. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 5: Land Management and Restoration - During 2004-2005, KPC's Board of Directors approved securing a majority ownership of the historic Warren Ranch, a working cattle ranch. The Board determined that the continued operations of the Warren Ranch were part of KPC's mission to protect the unique scenic, historic and natural sites on the Katy Prairie. They noted that well-managed farmland shelters wildlife, supplies scenic open space, and helps filter impurities from our air and water and that these agricultural lands offer many other benefits as well: preservation of open space and natural resources; outdoor recreation, including bird watching, hiking, hunting, and nature tours; improved flood protection; economic development through eco-tourism; enhanced wildlife habitat; recharge zones for the area's aquifers; educational field trips for area youth, and research opportunities for colleges and universities in ecology and land management. The prairie also provides children who might not otherwise have an opportunity to visit a working ranch to ride a horse or tour a farm to see how food is produced - a distinctive outdoor experience.","Long-term goals are to: protect 50,000 acres; allow public access; ensure responsible stewardship of protected lands; restore and enhance wildlife habitat; offer educational programs; and conduct and facilitate appropriate research to accomplish KPCs mission.","Land Conservation - The Katy Prairie Conservancy (KPC) protects land on the Katy Prairie in the following ways: acquisition of conservation lands at fair market value, acquisition of conservation lands through a bargain sale arrangement, receipt of donated conservation lands to KPC, receipt of donated trade lands to KPC, donation of conservation easements to KPC, and purchase of development rights on conservation lands on the Katy Prairie. Conservation lands are held in permanent trust and are maintained for the benefit of both the wildlife that inhabit the lands and the public who enjoy visiting KPC's preserves.##Preserve Enhancement - KPC has developed general management plans for all its protected properties that ensure that the lands are not further degraded by invasive species (including Chinese Tallow, McCartney Rose, feral hogs and other feral animals) and are maintained in their traditional uses. More detailed management plans are prepared for properties as KPC undertakes preserve enhancement and restoration activities, including the restoration and creation of wetlands and the enhancement and replanting of native grasslands.##Land Management and Restoration - During 2004-2005, KPC's Board of Directors approved securing a majority ownership of the historic Warren Ranch, a working cattle ranch.

The annual planetary Congress allows the members to work towards the organization's mission and vision by providing broad and deep professional technical interchanges among the members and attendees. Valuable exchanges of information and expertise are created by astronaut reunions. Presentations are delivered to the general public at the annual Congress. The organization provides online accessible information with weekly interchange through the ASE downlinks. Member/Astronaut appearances at schools and other public forums provide a platform for promoting the benefits of space science and exploration.##The organization participates in numerous educational activities designed to educate and inspire future generations around the benefits of space science, exploration and international cooperation.A key component of ASE's mission is to enable and grow a technically knowledgeable and proficient future workforce, which is part of a national education imperative to ensure our nation's future economic and scientific prosperity. As part of ASE's general outreach efforts, our astronaut and cosmonaut members visit schools, universities and youth groups world-wide and interact with thousands of teachers, parents and students each year. ASE continuously explores creative ways to engage and inspire the next generation of scientists, astronauts and engineers.In 2016, ASE-USA continued its partnership with Ardusat, Inc. and Northrop Grumman Corporation to provide exciting and unique opportunities for high-school aged teams to conduct their own real research experiment in Earth orbit on board a real satellite. Participants engage with focused online course content, and design and build their own programs to monitor any of the 20 sensors onboard, using a variety of real-time, online resources. This unique program is intended to drive students toward Science/Technology/Engineering/Math (STEM) education and careers and to give them hands on, project-based learning experience in multiple formats - in the classroom, through independent study, or via science clubs and other after-school activities. ASE-USA spent $15,300 to support teams from across the USA, who were selected to prepare and fly space experiments. At each Planetary Congress, ASE members dedicate a full day for outreach with the local and national communities in the country where the Congress is being hosted. The astronauts and cosmonauts reach thousands of students, teachers, parents, and members of the general public to inspire and promote education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. ASE-USA member astronauts also engage with students and teachers throughout the year in the USA with school and university visits and lectures, as well as via partnerships with other educational organizations.##Planet Stewardship. ASE provides members opportunities to communicate their unique perspective of Earth to help stimulate humanity's sense of responsibility for the future of our planet. Among ASE's premier activities in the area of environmental education is the partnership in the development and deployment of the on-orbit astronaut earth photography tool Windows on Earth. ASE also is a driving force in promoting international planning for Near Earth Objects (NEO) deflections and works with the United Nations to implement ASE NEO recommendations. ASE members are have also testified before the US congress on astronaut medical support.","The Association of Space Explorers (ASE) is the international professional and educational association of men and women who have flown in Earth orbit.

GEAA STAFF SOLICITS AND RECRUITS ADDITIONAL GEAA INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS AND MEMBER GROUPS, WORKING TO BUILD CONSENSUS BEHIND MEASURES TO PRESERVE OUR WATER SUPPLY AND THE TEXAS HILL COUNTRY. IN THIS WAY, GEAA EDUCATES THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN DO TO PRESERVE THE EDWARDS AQUIFER. KEY TO PROTECTION OF THE EDWARDS AQUIFER ECOSYSTEM IS THE CULTIVATION OF A POPULATION THAT IS AWARE OF THESE THREATS TO THEIR WATER SUPPLY, IS PREPARED TO ADVOCATE FOR SPECIFIC MEASURES TO PROTECT THE AQUIFER, AND WILL CONTRIBUTE SUPPORT FOR THESE EFFORTS. WE WERE HONORED TO RECEIVE THE 2006 ENVISION CENTRAL TEXAS COMMUNITY STEWARDSHIP AWARD FOR RAISING PUBLIC AWARENESS, AND TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR EXCELLENCE BY SAVE BARTON SPRINGS ASSOCIATION, LONE STAR SIERRA CLUB, AND OTHERS. OUR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: ""TO PRODUCE AND DISTRIBUTE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS THAT WILL ASSIST PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR DECISION MAKERS TO TAKE ACTIONS TO PROTECT AND SUSTAIN THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF EDWARDS AQUIFER FLOWS. ""TO EXPAND AND AID THE COORDINATION OF EXISTING PUBLIC INTEREST ADVOCACY FOR SUSTAINABLE WATER AND LAND USE PRACTICES IN THE GREATER EDWARDS AQUIFER REGION.""TO CATALYZE MUCH GREATER INVESTMENT BY PRIVATE NON-PROFIT AND FOR- PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND INDIVIDUALS IN EDWARDS AQUIFER WATERSHED PRESERVATION AND SUSTAINABLE WATER AND LAND-USE PRACTICES. TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, WE HAVE INITIATED THE FOLLOWING PROJECTS :CAPACITY BUILDING - GEAA STAFF PROVIDES MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS WITH LEGAL, TECHNICAL, PUBLIC RELATIONS AND PUBLICITY, FUNDRAISING AND ADMINISTRATIVE ADVICE AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS WITH FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR SPECIFIC PROJECTS THAT FURTHER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EDWARDS AQUIFER PROTECTION PLAN. GEAA HOSTS A RETREAT EACH YEAR TO ENGAGE REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS IN SETTING POLICY, INITIATING NEW PROGRAMS, AND ALLOCATING RESOURCES. GEAA ALSO PRESENTS WORKSHOPS FEATURING EXPERTS IN THE FIELDS OF PUBLIC RELATIONS, ORGANIZING, FUNDRAISING AND CAMPAIGNING, AS WELL AS PRESENTATIONS BY GOVERNMENT AND ELECTED OFFICIALS AND COMMUNITY ACTIVISTS, FOR THE BENEFIT OF GEAA MEMBER GROUPS AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. PUBLIC COMMENT AND AD HOC ISSUES - GEAA RECEIVES REQUESTS FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON A REGULAR BASIS ON A WIDE VARIETY OF ISSUES FROM INDIVIDUAL LANDOWNERS, REGIONAL MUNICIPALITIES, AND GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES SOLICITING PUBLIC COMMENT ON PROGRAMS AND POLICIES RELATING TO THE REGION'S GROUND AND SURFACE WATER SYSTEMS. THE EXPERTISE OF OUR TECHNICAL STAFF IS CRITICAL TO EXPANDING OUR CAPACITY TO PROMOTE ADEQUATE PROTECTION OF OUR WATER RESOURCES AND IS ESSENTIAL TO ACCOMPLISHING OUR GOALS. WE RELY UPON THE LARGESS OF SEVERAL EXPERTS WHO HAVE VOLUNTEERED THEIR TIME AND THE BENEFIT OF THEIR EXPERTISE AS NEEDED ON SPECIFIC PROJECTS. BECAUSE OF THE RECOGNIZED EXCELLENCE OF OUR WORK, GEAA IS REGULARLY CALLED UPON TO RESEARCH SPECIFIC ISSUES AND PROJECTS, TO COMMENT ON PROPOSED PROJECTS, RULES AND PROGRAMS, AND TO GENERATE POLICY AND REGULATORY RECOMMENDATIONS AND REMEDIES. GEAA PROVIDES PRACTICAL GUIDANCE TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES, ENHANCING OUR ABILITY TO FURTHER OUR GOAL OF AQUIFER PROTECTION BY FURNISHING EXPERTISE ON PROVEN METHODS AND PRACTICES TO DEVELOPERS REFERRED TO GEAA BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO ADVISE ON SPECIFIC PROJECTS. ADDITIONALLY, GEAA WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MUNICIPALITIES WITHIN THE EDWARDS REGION TO PROMOTE THE ADOPTION OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUES INTO THE CODES OF MUNICIPALITIES AND INTO STATE RECOMMENDED BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. UNDER YOUR FEET CAMPAIGN - MUCH OF THE RECENT GROWTH IN BEXAR COUNTY HAS TAKEN PLACE OVER THE RECHARGE AND CONTRIBUTING ZONES OF THE EDWARDS AQUIFER, RESULTING IN A TREND OF INCREASED CONTAMINATION OF OUR WATER SUPPLIES AND SPRING FLOWS. AREA HOMEOWNERS MUST BE EDUCATED ABOUT THE GEOLOGY OF THE EDWARDS AQUIFER AND HOW TO LIVE IN THIS EXTREMELY ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREA. A SUITE OF PRESENTATIONS, ON-LINE RESOURCES, SOCIAL MEDIA, AND PRINT MATERIALS WILL TEACH THEM ABOUT ACTIONS THEY CAN TAKE TO PROTECT OUR AQUIFER, INCLUDING HOW TO HANDLE AND STORE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS, WHAT COMMON HOUSEHOLD PRACTICES POSE A THREAT TO THE INTEGRITY OF SEWAGE SYSTEMS, AND HOW TO PLANT AND MAINTAIN LANDSCAPING IN THIS UNIQUE REGION. MODELED ON THE SUCCESSFUL ""UNDER YOUR FEET"" CAMPAIGNS IN KENTUCKY AND FLORIDA, GEAA IS WORKING WITH THE CREATORS OF THESE PROGRAMS TO ADAPT THEM TO THE EDWARDS REGION. COMMUNITY RAIN GARDENS PROJECT - GEAA IS WORKING WITH HOME OWNERS' ASSOCIATIONS TO CREATE COMMUNITY RAIN GARDENS. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM GEAA WILL NEIGHBORHOODS TO INSTALL LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID) PROJECTS SUCH AS SWALES, RAIN GARDENS, AND SPECIFIC PLANTINGS TO ENHANCE FILTRATION OF STORMWATER BEFORE IT ENTERS THE AQUIFER. LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS WITH EXPERTISE IN LID WILL BE EMPLOYED TO DESIGN AND HELP HOMEOWNERS TO PROPERLY INSTALL AND MAINTAIN SITE SPECIFIC LID ENHANCEMENTS. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, WE HOPE TO EDUCATE HOMEOWNERS ON THE EDWARDS AQUIFER RECHARGE ZONE HOW TO IDENTIFY AND REPORT NON-COMPLIANT SYSTEMS, TO ENHANCE THE FUNCTION OF THE SYSTEMS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS, AND TO GENERALLY EDUCATE THEM ON THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING THE EDWARDS AQUIFER. CONSENSUS BUILDING GEAA REPRESENTS THE CONSENSUS POSITIONS OF OUR MEMBER GROUPS IN MANY REGIONAL PROCESSES AND ADVISORY COMMITTEES CONVENED TO ADDRESS VARIOUS WATER ISSUES, INCLUDING THE EDWARDS AQUIFER RECOVERY IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM, BEXAR REGIONAL WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT GROUP, COMAL COUNTY STAKEHOLDERS GROUP, SA TOMORROW, AND OTHERS. EDUCATION PROGRAMS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC HOLDS IS THAT THE EDWARDS AQUIFER, LIKE MOST OTHER AQUIFERS, FILTERS WATER ENTERING ITS RESERVOIR THROUGH LAYERS OF SAND AND GRAVEL. THE EDWARDS, HOWEVER, IS A KARST AQUIFER. THE KARST LIMESTONE STRUCTURE OF THE EDWARDS AQUIFER ALLOWS FOR ONLY MINIMAL FILTRATION OF WATER ENTERING THE AQUIFER, MAKING IT VULNERABLE TO CONTAMINATION FROM URBAN RUNOFF ""NONPOINT SOURCE"" POLLUTION. TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC, GEAA HAS DESIGNED A COMPREHENSIVE CURRICULUM OF ACCURATE, UP-TO-DATE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION ON CAVE FORMATION AND THE CHEMISTRY, GEOLOGY, AND BIOLOGY OF KARST AQUIFERS. DURING 2013 GEAA PRESENTED 45 CLASSROOM DEMONSTRATIONS, LECTURES AND LABS AND 10 FIELD TRIPS TO GOVERNMENT CANYON STATE NATURAL AREA. ""TEACHERS IN-SERVICE PROGRAMS SERVE MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE TEACHERS OFSAN ANTONIO'S SEVENTEEN INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. FREE WORKSHOPS ON KARST GEOLOGY AND THE EDWARDS AQUIFER INCLUDE DEMONSTRATIONS OF LAB EXERCISES, PRESENTATIONS BY EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF KARST GEOLOGY AND A GUIDED TOUR OF A KARST RECHARGE CAVE. TEACHERS RECEIVE TEXAS ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS (TEKS) AND TEXAS ASSESSMENT OF KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS (TAKS) APPROPRIATE CURRICULA, MAPS AND AUDIOVISUAL PRESENTATIONS FOR USE IN THE CLASS ROOM, LAB EXERCISES, LECTURES AND HANDS- ON DEMONSTRATIONS ABOUT ALL ASPECTS OF KARST AQUIFERS, INCLUDING HUMAN IMPACT ON THE EDWARDS AQUIFER. ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY TEACHERS EACH YEAR EARN CONTINUING EDUCATION CREDIT BY PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROGRAM. OUR ANIMATED DVD/CD ROM ""INNER VIEW OF THE EDWARDS AQUIFER"", PRODUCED INPARTNERSHIP WITH KLRN TV, HAS BEEN WIDELY DISTRIBUTED TO AREA TEACHERS.

Our goal is to enrich the lives of Americas homeless by providing clean bottled water, delivered with a daily, inspirational message of hope, and love.","Water Program: The I Am Waters Foundation provides physical and spiritual hydration to America's homeless through our designated shelter partners and homeless service care providers. Since 2010, we have delivered 4,174,209 branded bottles of water with words of inspiration and encouragement inscribed on them, such as Hope, Love, Peace and Dream, throughout Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Arkansas. All bottles are rPet bottles that are 100% recyclable.##I Am Jobs by I Am Waters: A study was conducted in 2016, ""When Water Meets a Higher Need: A Study of an Unprecedented Mission,"" in order to assess the impact and efficacy of IAW's program. The water and the word are invitations to initiate a conversation within themselves to begin the process of reintegration into society and improve their quality of life. When a person is ready, job placement becomes a crucial step to ending homelessness and beginning self-sufficiency. There is a hot-line for the homeless to call when they are ready to work. IAW staff then assesses the individual and enters them in the Airtable database and assists the candidate with a resume if needed. IAW staff is developing corporate relationships for job opportunities for the candidates. The I Am Jobs program also includes mentoring through the process of obtaining and keeping a job. The goal is for the candidate to gain meaningful employment for at least a year and then be a mentor in the program themselves.##Face of the American Homeless (Image Campaign): The Face of the American Homeless program has been established to bring a face to who the American homeless are. I Am Waters discovered that a highly productive and meaningful way to engage with the homeless community and create a dialogue was to organize a photo-shoot at the various shelters. With the help of a professional photographer, we captured the images of dozens of homeless and used these images as a way to talk with them about their current situation. We pair the images with statistics about the homeless.","Provide fresh, clean water to the homeless.",2.018208293493005e+17,15249171.0,990,4/6/2018 8:22:31 AM,I AM WATERS FOUNDATION INC,201710.0,2018.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0

93493017008238.0,760279876,EFILE,,,,,"OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 4: GBFs research program focuses on the monitoring of some of Galveston Bays most valuable coastal resources. Several programs utilize trained citizen scientists to augment professional monitoring data and aid in watershed planning. In 2016, GBFs Volunteer Water Monitoring Team was represented (at year-end) by 57 volunteers who sampled from 59 sites. GBF continued to contribute our water quality data to the Citizen Science Data Portal, a part of the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Ocean Observing System (GCOOS). We also trained 15 citizen monitors for the new Bottlenose Dolphin Field Research Assistant program and utilized their services on seven boat-based dolphin surveys in Upper Galveston Bay conducted by program partner, Environmental Institute of Houston. GBF continued to be actively engaged in discussion and planning on improving coastal resiliency and to advocate for the allocation of research dollars to the region to ensure the health of Galveston Bay and its users.",The Galveston Bay Foundation works to ensure a clean and healthy Galveston Bay that can be enjoyed by people today and for generations to come. Our diverse programs preserve and protect Texas largest and most productive estuary.,"GBFs conservation programs focus on estuarine habitat preservation, protection, and restoration. Continuing our work as a nationally accredited land trust, GBF acquired over 140 acres of new fee simple conservation properties in 2016, including 102 acres along Chocolate Bayou in Brazoria County, 8.55 acres adjacent to our Sweetwater Nature Preserve in Galveston County, and 29.96 acres in Kemah in Galveston County that will be restored as a habitat demonstration area and opened to the public as part of the future Galveston Bay Education Center and headquarters for GBF. We also acquired a conservation easement on a 216-acre Coastal Heritage Preserve tract in Galveston County and hosted the Grand Opening and Ribbon Cutting Ceremony at another property on which we hold a conservation easement, the Turtle Bayou Nature Preserve in Chambers County. GBF also worked extensively in 2016 to restore degraded habitats around Galveston Bay. We coordinated the restoration of 70 acres of intertidal marsh by partnering with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Natural Resources Damage Assessment Trustees to beneficially use material dredged from the GIWW to restore wetland habitat; constructed and planted 33 marsh mounds as part of phase 2 of the Burnet Bay Wetlands Restoration project; completed two living shorelines projects with private landowners and hosted a living shorelines workshop for contractors, agency partners, and homeowners; planted 132 trees at locations including Rich Sanctuary and Turtle Bayou Nature Preserve in Chambers County and Sweetwater Preserve in Galveston County; and planted one acre of intertidal marsh at the Shipe Woods project site and 1.5 acres at the Oyster Lake project site. We welcomed a new restaurantTookies Seafoodto our Galveston Bay Oyster Shell Recycling Program and continued collecting shells from Tommys Restaurant and Oyster Bar, Topwater Grill, the Kemah Boardwalk, Crazy Alans Swamp Shack, and Captain Bennys Seafood, reclaiming 168 tons of shells, a 28% increase from the previous year. Utilizing some of this reclaimed oyster shell, we constructed approximately 200 feet of oyster bars within Sweetwater Lake with assistance from 128 volunteers during eight volunteer workdays and gardened oysters with the assistance of over 60 volunteers who deployed 7,800 oyster shells, 30% of which contained newly grown spat, on existing restoration reefs in Kemah, San Leon, and Galveston. GBF also hosted numerous community-based habitat enhancement events including TPWDs annual Abandoned Crab Trap Removal event at the Fort Anahuac Park site, in which we removed 268 crab traps from Trinity Bay with the assistance of 85 volunteers and 10 boats; a River, Lakes, Bays, N Bayous Trash Bash event at Bay Area Park, in which 585 volunteers collected an estimated 1.1 tons of trash, recyclables, and compostable materials as well as 49 tires from the Armand Bayou watershed; a trash cleanup site with the Port of Houston Authority at Morgans Point as part of the Texas Adopt-A-Beach Cleanup program, in which 84 volunteers collected 1,800 pounds of trash and 1,000 pounds of recyclable materials from a 1.3-mile stretch of shoreline; and marsh grass planting events, including Marsh Mania events in the fall and spring, at Beach City, Anahuac, Dickinson, and Brazoria County involving 121 volunteers in planting 4.09 acres of estuarine intertidal marsh.##GBFs education programs allowed us to reach thousands of youth and adults in 2016, with events and campaigns aimed at increasing the publics awareness of the importance of Galveston Bay as well as more structured programs that provide science-based environmental education focused on Galveston Bay. We hosted the tenth annual Bike Around the Bay sponsored by Shell, which allowed us to bring our message to more than 1,460 registered cyclists and over 300 volunteers and expose them to the beauty of the Bay. We also hosted the Bay Day Festival at the Kemah Boardwalk, with 35 educational exhibits, support from 87 volunteers, and an estimated attendance of over 4,800 visitors. We concluded the 2015-16 Get Hip to Habitat year by serving 1,500 students at 19 schools and kicked off the 2016-17 school year with participation by 15 schools. We delivered Bay Ambassador presentations to 2,000 students and professional development training workshops and resources to 30 educators. GBF also hosted nine Rain Barrel Workshops and delivered 489 rain barrels and kits into local communities, potentially reducing 546,450 gallons of stormwater runoff from reaching Galveston Bay and improving water conservation within our watershed. We continued our outreach efforts on the Cease the Grease campaign with over 15 participating partners and established a cooking oil recycling station in partnership with the City of Nassau Bay.##GBFs advocacy program attempts to balance the multiple uses of Galveston Bay so that the long-term interests of the Bay itself are not compromised. In 2016, we engaged in dialogue with local staff of our U.S. and State representatives and senators on a variety of Galveston Bay issues including San Jacinto River Waste Pits, storm surge mitigation, seafood consumption safety, closure of Rollover Pass, and the Clean Waters Rule (Waters of the U.S.). Of critical importance, we advocated for removal of the dioxin wastes at the San Jacinto River Waste Pits in Channelview by providing official comments to EPA and educating and rallying local community members, recreational fishermen, commercial fishermen, and all eight local U.S. congressmen to support the call for removal. GBF also began meeting with local stakeholders to discuss the No Discharge Zone initiative for Galveston Bay. In partnership with the Houston Advanced Research Center, GBF released the second annual Galveston Bay Report Card in 2016, with the Bay earning an overall grade of C, and continued our efforts to spread the message on how the Galveston Bay community can work to improve this grade. Through our partnership with Texas Living Waters, we helped to launch the Texas Water Conservation Scorecard, an analysis that ranks 306 Texas water utilities according to their water conservation efforts. We also launched the Galveston Bay Water Brigade, a campaign designed to raise awareness of the effect of water conservation on environmental flows and freshwater inflows for Galveston Bay, and partnered with City of Houstons Sustainability Office to include it as part of the 2016 City of Houston Green Office Challenge. We also engaged Hispanic community leaders and citizens in water-related issues through the event Strengthening Alliances for our Regions Water Future and the newly created Facebook page ATH: Agua Para Todos Houston. GBF began development of a downloadable mobile app for the Galveston Bay Action Network pollution reporting tool that allows the public to report pollution around the Bay and automatically forwards those reports to one of eleven authorities in charge of response/enforcement. Our volunteer Wetland Permit Review Committeeactive for a consecutive 27 yearsreviewed 28 applications for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permits and provided letters of concern or comments on 7 of them.","The mission of the Galveston Bay Foundation is to preserve, protect, and enhance the natural resources of the Galveston Bay estuarine system and its tributaries for present users and for posterity.",2.0183017934930083e+17,15207071.0,990,3/7/2018 8:31:27 PM,GALVESTON BAY FOUNDATION INC,201612.0,2018.0,,10.0,3.0,201712.0,13956748.0,7983839.0,GALVESTON BAY FOUNDATION,1100 HERCULES AVE STE 200,HOUSTON,TX,,C32,813312.0,77058.0,IN,,198805.0,48201.0,15.0,3360.0,3362.0,4272205.0,16eofinextract990.dat,201512.0,5917902.0,12.0,0.2791315590474871,C32,C,C,PC,EN,C,EN,O,EN,OT,Y,N,1.0

Responsibilities include maintaining and cleaning the Parks grounds, water features, and hardscapes; planting and watering trees; and weeding. The Conservancy manages the maintenance program for the 15-acre McGovern Centennial Gardens. Conservancy maintenance workers keep the gardens in top condition, ensuring that the gardens are well tended through each season. The Cherie Flores Garden Pavilion and Celebration Garden, McGovern Centennial Gardens rental venues, are available to host private events in an elegant urban garden setting. The volunteer program supports the McGovern Centennial Gardens staff as well as lending a hand throughout the Park.

Visitor Services oversees and operates the train, pedal boats, and Pinewood Cafe, and coordinates activities with the Conservancy Gift Shop and food vendors throughout the Park. The department hosts special programs at Lake Plaza including a yearly birthday party for Park namesake, George Hermann, the holiday train, a festive holiday party with arts and crafts and other activities, holiday brunches at Pinewood Cafe and student performances. Approximately 40 staff members are responsible for creating an exciting and memorable experience for Park visitors and keeping Lake Plaza operating efficiently and safely. The maintenance team is responsible for the cleaning and upkeep of Lake Plaza.##Planning, Design and Construction The Conservancy identified underdeveloped areas of the Park that could be developed into more visitor-friendly landscapes and brought prominent landscape architecture firm, Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, on board to study the Park's needs and develop an updated master plan to guide improvements for the next 20 years. The Conservancy and the City of Houston collaborated on a restoration project in the Japanese Garden ahead of the garden's 25th anniversary in 2017.

To meet the demands of this new management agreement, the Conservancy incurred large start-up costs to purchase equipment, materials, and supplies and to nearly double staff and contractors. Park management software was purchased to improve staff efficiency, customer service and to track productivity; a new cloud based document retention system and an electronic timekeeping system were part of additional technological improvements. Special projects included resurfacing trails, updating signage, maps, and entrances throughout the Park, repairing damage after two unusual flood events, increasing mowing from every 21 days to every 7-14 days, daily clearing and de-littering of ADA ramps and high-use parking lots, and daily restroom and sanitation services. The Conservancy also has arobust internship and research program for studying the diverse aspects of managing, improving and maintaining a forested urban park. In addition to this work, more than 3,000 volunteer hours were contributed toward the rehabilitation and beautification of the Park, all while working alongside professional staff and vocational horticulturists such as Master Naturalists and Master Gardeners.##See Schedule OEcological Restoration: This year's ecological restoration and conservation program included convening an Eco-Tech panel of area experts that met frequently throughout the year to address and find solutions for ecological issues within the Park. The Conservancy treated approximately 190 acres for invasive species to prepare for the ecological restoration projects identified in the Memorial Park Master Plan. Two thousand trees were planted as part of ecological restoration work for the Eastern Glades project in partnership with Trees for Houston. The Conservancy finalized an in-depth tree inventory to build on existing landscaped areas inventory and provided habitat assessment in select locations. In conjunction with this, a biological assessment was initiated to identify and inventory all living creatures in the Park (insects, animals, and plants). As part of an ongoing fuels management program, over 140 acres were treated for hazardous fuels reduction including the removal of 900 hazard trees. Over 1,000 stumps were ground as part of ongoing park care. A native meadow grass demonstration garden was installed to inform the success of future projects. In addition to ecological care of the natural environment, sensitive maintenance was the focus of the Conservancy's volunteer and community outreach program.##See Schedule OCapital Improvements: The Conservancy, in partnership with the Uptown Houston Tax Reinvestment Zone #17, implemented capital improvements as part of the Master Plan. All Master Plan Phase 1 projects were developed through conceptual design. The first Master Plan project, the Eastern Glades, broke ground. Project planning and design work progressed including archeological studies for Memorial Groves; preparation of construction drawings for Phase 1 of Eastern Glades; and schematic design work for the Park's Hogg Bird Sanctuary led by partnering organization Houston Parks Board. MPC supported the installation of a 12"" water line and the final phase of resurfacing the popular exercise trail in the Park. As part of advancing future capital improvements to the Park, a capital campaign was launched and raised over $10M in pledges at the end of the fiscal year.","Memorial Park Conservancy (MPC) is dedicated to the preservation and enhancement of Memorial Park for today and for future generations; to public use, enjoyment and education in accordance with conditions of the conveyance to the City of Houston.",2.0182106934930125e+17,15289578.0,990,5/4/2018 9:43:05 PM,MEMORIAL PARK CONSERVANCY INC,201705.0,2018.0,,10.0,3.0,201705.0,26290646.0,9373467.0,MEMORIAL PARK CONSERVANCY INC,7575 N PICNIC,HOUSTON,TX,,C1130,813219.0,77007.0,IN,,200010.0,48201.0,15.0,3360.0,3362.0,1939810.0,core2014pc,201505.0,1518538.0,5.0,0.11205426763852787,C113,C,C,PC,EN,C,ZA,S,EN,OT,Y,N,1.0

Last year the HAS Natives Nursery was upgraded to increase the plant-growing capacity for local bird-friendly community-based projects and for regional partners working to increase pollinator habitats. In 2016 HAS applied for and subsequently was awarded accreditation under the national program for land trusts, demonstrating its commitment to quality standards for protecting natural places and a sound program of land stewardship.##EDUCATION & OUTREACH: Last year HAS provided 979 unique natural science programs to over 47,000 children and adults at its two urban nature centers and through its extensive programming throughout the Houston-Galveston area. Program offerings include nature camps, outreach programs to schools and community groups, onsite workshops and tours, naturalist-led field trips, and citizen science bird surveys and watch events. HAS also sponsors regular speaker programs, publishes a bi-monthly newsletter, and hosts an informative website covering topics of interest to birders and nature enthusiasts. In 2016 the HAS website was redesigned to better accommodate mobile platforms and to incorporate a Bird Friendly Houston component, with the goal of transforming Houston into a city that celebrates birds and values natural spaces.",The vision of Houston Audubon Society (HAS) is a healthier natural environment and a more beautiful place to live created by leading and nurturing a community that values and supports birds.,2.0180130934930406e+17,15646269.0,990,8/31/2018 6:23:16 PM,HOUSTON AUDUBON SOCIETY INC,201706.0,2018.0,,10.0,3.0,201706.0,7745221.0,1920590.0,HOUSTON AUDUBON SOCIETY,440 WILCHESTER BLVD,HOUSTON,TX,,C30,813312.0,77079.0,IN,,197001.0,48201.0,16.0,3360.0,3362.0,7095240.0,16eofinextract990.dat,201506.0,1370346.0,6.0,0.4802841559779471,C30,C,C,PC,EN,C,EN,O,EN,OT,Y,N,1.0

OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 8: Hike and Bike Trails - A top priority of Buffalo Bayou Partnership is to build a continuous system of trails on the north and south banks of Buffalo Bayou from Shepherd Drive to the Turning Basin. This will give Houstonians and visitors 20 miles of trails to run, walk and bike along our waterway. To accommodate residents and visitors who want to enjoy a walk or jog along the Shepherd Drive to Sabine Street stretch of the bayou, BBP added asphalt footpaths closer to the waterway.","Buffalo Bayou Partnership (""BBP"") is transforming and revitalizing Buffalo Bayou, Houstons most significant natural resource.

The project involved flood management, eco-restoration, new hike and bike trails and an array of park amenities. The park improvements were substantially completed for the Buffalo Bayou Park project in 2015, and BBP transferred ownership to the City. BBP maintains and operates the 160-acre Buffalo Bayou Park and is also responsible for maintaining the hike and bike trails and green spaces along the waterway from Sabine to Fannin streets. To assist with ongoing maintenance and conservation efforts, BBP relies on thousands of volunteers and community service workers each year that remove weeds and invasive species, plant wildflowers, pick up trash and remove silt from the trails after heavy rains.##Buffalo Bayou Partnership Special Events - BBP offers a wide-range of recreational and cultural activities, including:Buffalo Bayou Partnership Regatta - Annual 15-mile canoe and kayak race on Buffalo Bayou from Voss Road to Sesquicentennial Park in Downtown Houston, held in March.Kids Day - A free event filled with family fun, educational activities, music, food, dazzling park performers, and bayou boat rides, held annually in October.

Currently, over 900 acres are actively managed within our preserve boundaries. Critical prairie habitat is annually being restored and then preserved through controlled burns and mowing to reduce invasive species and replanting native grasses and forbs propagated in our native plant nursery. More recently, ABNC has assumed management of a 24-acre tract that specifically protects the endangered Prairie Dawn Flower species. Additionally, ABNC manages over 330 acres of Texas State Coastal Preserve in the Armand Bayou watershed, restoring intertidal marsh to maintain appropriate water depth and encourage native plant and animal recolonization.##Education: Over 9,500 students of all ages participate in ABNC environmental education programs annually. School groups attend Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) correlated outdoor classes, field trips, and unique natural and cultural history programs. ABNC offers outdoor nature camps each summer and winter, scouting and similar youth programs, and community outreaches. ABNC has also introduced a range of early-childhood outdoor programs and STEM focused classes to support home school programs.##Visitor Services: Over 20,000 guests visit ABNC annually, another 2,000 member visits are also recorded. Almost 2,500 people travel to ABNC to attend meetings and private events each year. Visitors follow the self-guided accessible Discovery Trail interpretive loop to habitat overlooks, interpretive exhibits and historical farm displays; others venture out on over 5 miles of developed hiking trails. Volunteers help ABNC conduct numerous interpretive activities, including guided trail hikes, animal demonstrations, hands-on-history craft demonstrations, and guided canoe and pontoon boat tours of Armand Bayou. ABNC special places are also available for family retreats, company meetings and seasonal parties. Several community groups utilize ABNC meeting spaces, and ABNC regularly hosts nature-related conferences.",To preserve the habitats with which we have been entrusted and to provide opportunities for people to experience and understand the local ecosystems.

ALL OBJECTIVES WERE MET IN 2017: RESTORED DEGRADED HABITATS THROUGH THE BIRD ISLAND COVE GRASS PLANTING; CREATED NEW HABITATS THROUGH THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY NEARSHORE REEF; ADVANCED THE SCIENCE OF HABITAT RESTORATION AND CONSERVATION WITH THE HARTE RESEARCH INSTITUTE NEARSHORE REEFING STUDY; FOSTERED HABITAT STEWARDSHIP THROUGH THE LOUISIANA TAG PROGRAM; AND EDUCATED COASTAL COMMUNITIES OF THE VALUE OF CONSERVATION WITH THE BILLION OYSTER PROJECT, DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE NEW YORK HARBOR SCHOOL.##CCA'S NATIONAL HABITAT PROGRAM, THE BUILDING CONSERVATION TRUST (BCT), FUNDED $262,200 FOR THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY (RGV) REEF, DONE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH FRIENDS OF RGV REEF AND CCA TEXAS.THE IMPETUS FOR THE CREATION OF THIS REEF WAS TO PROVIDE GRADUATED STEPPING STONES OF HABITAT THAT WOULD ALLOW FISH TO GROW FROM JUVENILES TO ADULTS. REEFS WILL ATTRACT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FISH, BUT MORE ARE ABLE TO GROW IF A SITE INCLUDES A SMALL REEF FOR SMALLER FISH, A MID-SIZED REEF FOR MID-SIZED FISH AND A LARGE REEF FOR LARGER FISH. THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY REEF UTILIZES VARIOUS MATERIALS TO CATER TO DIFFERENT SPECIES, SUCH AS CINDER BLOCKS, LARGE CONCRETE PYRAMIDS AND SUNKEN SHRIMP BOATS. A RECENT PHASE OF THE REEF WILL SEE THE DEVELOPMENT OF 60,000-240,000 RED SNAPPER PER YEAR, WITH 50 PERCENT REMAINING IN THE GULF. THIS GROWTH WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON THE LOCAL ECONOMY AND BUSINESSES. STUDIES ARE CONTINUOUSLY BEING ADMINISTERED ON EFFICIENCY AND EFFICACY OF THE GROWING REEF BY THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS RIO GRANDE VALLEY AND TEXAS A&M GALVESTON. DR. RICK KLINE OF UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS RIO GRANDE VALLEY PRESENTED A PAPER ON THE SITE'S FIRST TEST CINDER BLOCK NURSERY REEF AT THE AMERICAN FISHERIES CONFERENCE. DR. JAY ROOKER AND HIS RESEARCHERS FROM TEXAS A&M GALVESTON RECENTLY COUNTED 1,700 IMMEDIATE POST-SETTLEMENT JUVENILE RED SNAPPER ON ONE OF THE SITE'S 300 NURSERY PATCHES THAT ARE LESS THAN 30 DAYS OLD. THESE STUDIES ARE BOLSTERING FISH POPULATIONS THROUGH IMPROVED MANAGEMENT AND DATA COLLECTION. A CURRENT STUDY ON LOCAL DEMOGRAPHICS AND THOSE SERVED BY THE REEF IS CURRENTLY BEING CONDUCTED AS WELL. WIDE SUPPORT FROM THE COMMUNITY AND LOCAL UNIVERSITIES ENSURES THAT PERFORMANCE METRICS WILL CONTINUE AT THIS SITE. THE LONG-TERM VISION OF THE RGV REEF IS TO HAVE LOW RELIEF MATERIALS IN THE REEF SITE FOR THE SMALL MARINE LIFE AND FISH, AND HIGHER RELIEF MATERIALS, SUCH AS PRE-CONSTRUCTED PYRAMIDS, FOR HIGHER RELIEF HABITAT AND LARGER FISH, THUS CREATING A ""LIFE-CYCLE"" REEF. THIS PROJECT WILL POSITIVELY IMPACT LOCAL ECONOMIES, INCREASE RECREATIONAL FISHING OPPORTUNITIES, CREATE NEW HABITAT FOR MARINE LIFE AND BUFFER COASTAL HABITATS FROM TROPICAL STORMS AND WAVE ENERGY.##CCA'S NATIONAL HABITAT PROGRAM, THE BUILDING CONSERVATION TRUST (BCT), FUNDED $185,000 FOR BIG JACK'S REEF, DONE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CCA LOUISIANA, SHELL OIL COMPANY, LDWF AND OTHERS.COASTAL EROSION AND MANMADE CHANGES TO CALCASIEU LAKE HAVE ENDANGERED OYSTERS AND OTHER MARINE LIFE BY ALTERING THEIR NATURAL HABITATS OVER THE PAST CENTURY, AND COASTAL CONSERVATION GROUPS ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO REVITALIZE THE AREA.THE FIVE-ACRE REEF IS COMPRISED OF RECYCLED WHOLE AND CRUSHED CONCRETE. BIG JACK'S REEF IS AN EFFORT TO RESTORE THE LAKE'S FISHERIES AND OYSTER POPULATION. THE REEF CONSISTS OF ABOUT 800 RECYCLED CONCRETE PILINGS THAT WERE PLACED IN A PARALLEL ARRANGEMENT ACROSS THE FIVE-ACRE SITE. IT WAS THEN TOPPED WITH CRUSHED CONCRETE TO PROVIDE A MORE AGGREGATED SURFACE.

Education and outreach programs occur in a wide variety of formats and reach diverse audiences. During the tax year, some of TALT's outreach efforts included: landowner workshops in Victoria, Bay City and Austin; sponsorship and attendance at the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Ranch Gatherings across the state; hosting information booths at the Texas Wildlife Association annual convention, TSSWCB, Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Annual Conventions, Texas Chapter of The Wildlife Society annual meeting, South Texas Property Rights Association annual meeting; Trans-Pecos Wildlife Conference, and the Texas Grazing Land Coalition Workshop. In addition, TALT celebrated its 10th Anniversary in March of 2018 with a fundraising celebration in Victoria, TX. One hundred and twenty local landowners and statewide supporters attended the event to celebrate 10 years of conservation of working lands. TALTs anniversary was also commemorated through Texas Senate Proclamation 312 commending TALT for preserving the states agricultural lands.Through the use of its newsletter, social media and speaking engagements, TALT educates an urban audience regarding the public benefits of rural working lands. TALT staff and board members additionally penned several opinion editorials that were published in major Texas newspapers highlighting the values of private working lands, as they relate to current events.##Conservation easements to protect working lands: TALT partners with landowners who seek donated conservation easements, purchase of development rights, and mitigation banking conservation easements. TALT staff provides professional, efficient, responsive and experienced service for the negotiations of conservation easements. TALT will then monitor and steward these easements on an annual basis. TALT's processes have been developed over the past eleven years and incorporate best management practices from the Land Trust Alliance (LTA) and from members of the Partnership of Rangeland Trusts (PORT). At the end of the tax year, TALT held conservation easements on over 226,000 acres of Texas farms and ranches throughout the state. TALT today is the largest state-based land trust in Texas and numbers among in the top 15 regional or state wide land trusts in the country according to a recent LTA census.","The mission of the Texas Agricultural Land Trust (TALT) is to conserve the Texas heritage of agricultural lands, natural resources and wildlife habitats. TALT works to sustain the long-term stewardship of private lands for the benefit of all Texans. TALT accomplishes its mission through the use of voluntary conservation measures and through education and outreach efforts. TALT partners with private landowners to negotiate and transact conservation easements that protect important conservation values, in accordance with IRC Section 170(h). These privately stewarded lands provide public benefits such as productive agricultural lands, scenic views, drinking water protection, natural wildlife habitat and open space. Additionally, with a state that holds 94% privately owned lands, TALT works to educate the public on the many public benefits provided by the stewardship of private lands, and to educate Texas landowners about the use of conservation easements.
