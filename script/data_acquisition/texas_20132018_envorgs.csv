See Part III, Line 4b.##OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 4: YWE: WEN's signature program, Young Women Energized, introduces high school girls to the energy industry and holds an annual event for them to engage with professional women and learn about various careers in the industry. This program was started in 2004. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 5: Charity Event: Members of Women's Energy Network are actively involved in the community all across Houston. Women's Energy Network is pleased to sponsor chosen charities and bring its members information on volunteer opportunities in local organizations. Since 2000, Women's Energy Network has supported and raised money through charity events for organizations such as Women Helping Women, Girls, Inc, the Houston Area Women's Center, Boys and Girls Country, and Community Family Center.Mentoring: WEN instituted a Mentoring Program in 2007. This provides an opportunity for WEN members to enrich their careers by expanding their networks, growing their knowledge and diversifying their experience. WEN members who wish to be mentored will identify specific learning goals and will be matched in mentoring circles with WEN mentors who best meet their learning goals and who will work with them to achieve those goals over the scheduled term.","A global organization that educates, attracts, retains, and develops professional women working across the energy value chain. WEN develops programs to provide networking opportunities and foster career and leadership development of women who work in the energy industry.","Membership: The Women's Energy Network of Houston was founded in 1994 with the purpose of fostering the development and advancement of women in energy by developing a strong network. After years of being the sole woman involved in energy transactions, Women's Energy Network's founder believed that many women energy professionals were in the same position, but unable to connect with each other. Years later, the Women's Energy Network remains committed to providing high caliber events and networking to its diverse membership from across the energy value chain. WEN Houston also sponsors new chapters and retains some of the membership fees for support.##In 2013, WEN held the first Womens Energy Network Conference. The Conference will be held biannually. This is a national event that runs over 2 days. In 2013, the Conference had approximately 245 attendees (members and non-members). The Conference featured 4 separate tracks with educational sessions and more than 50 speakers. As with other WEN events there were technical sessions and professional development sessions. The Conference afforded the attendees valuable career networking opportunities.##Education and Networking - Luncheons, special events, webinars: Each month Women's Energy Network hosts luncheons for 80-150 members and guests featuring exceptional leaders in energy or other relevant businesses. Guests are also welcome. Women's Energy Network offers growth opportunities to its members through participation on its Board of Directors and special programs. Women's Energy Network is based on the model of the premier women's leadership development program, Leadership Texas, which focuses on networking, education, and community. This includes all Houston area luncheons (energy corridor, downtown, and north side), webinars, and special events such as wine tasting, networking event, fashion events, etc.","Women's Energy Network of Houston""s mission is to is to attract more women into energy through outreach programs.

Today, in every area, our sustainable story dominates civic discussion. We have slowly changed the direction of the City and region, and will continue to capitalize on these gains to realize a vision we know from surveys is shared by the people of Houston. Houston Tomorrow promotes sustainable development of our regions built environment. How we build infrastructure and other facilities impacts whether our citizens have access to quality food and water; to streets that are safe for all users; to greenspaces and parks; to walkable neighborhoods, to a healthier lifestyle, and to a choice of transportation types that includes walking, biking, driving, and transit.##Houston Tomorrow works to align public spending and policies with citizen priorities to distribute scarce infrastructure money in a balanced way among transit, road repair, bike and pedestrian facilities, and new roads. We address issues of equity and work to bring meaningful equity to regional decision making on transportation funding and planning for the future of all our communities.Opportunity Network, a collaboration of public and private entities focused on improving the quality of community and economic opportunity in the region. Houston Tomorrow recognizes that the built environment in our 134 towns and cities is an investment that needs to be maintained and improved, and advocates for sustainable development in many neighborhoods in these existing places, rather than in natural and agricultural lands at the edges of the region.##Houston Tomorrow is recognized as a trusted, independent information source that provides research, analysis, and best practices to keep citizens, policymakers, and business leaders informed about sustainable development. We do this broadly through our website, newsletter, ongoing public events, incisive presentations, input to the policy making process, and white papers and publications.

MPC also went out into the community, speaking to different groups such as the Greater Houston Partnership to the National Honor Society at Lamar High School. The Conservancy also participated in city-wide events including Houston Marathons Charity Village, Earth Day Houston, Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo Nonprofit Partner Program, and Arbor Day. MPC also engaged with current and prospective supporters through the Green Gala, Golf Tournament, and a Fun Run, which included over 1,700 runners in the Park.CAPACITY BUILDINGThe Conservancy is actively building internal infrastructure to prepare for implementation of the Master Plan capital campaign. This included hiring additional staff, bringing total staff to six full-time employees. Board governance and structure was assessed with a professional consulting firm. Technology was upgraded as well as communication materials including redesigning the MPC website, creating and mailing a newsletter, and producing an informative annual report.","The mission of the Memorial Park Conservancy is to restore, preserve and enhance Memorial Park for the enjoyment of all Houstonians, today and tomorrow.","CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND PARK MAINTENANCEIn September, the Conservancy along with the HPARD broke ground on the new Running Trails Center. When completed, the Center will feature lockers and showers for the use of runners, bicyclists, and other park visitors, vending machines, and office space for the Memorial Park Conservancy. The Center is located on the south side of the Park, near the Living Bridge, and along with amenities, will provide much-needed additional parking. A new stretching deck was installed on the north side of the Park, and was constructed with the assistance of volunteers. The Conservancy continued planning for improvements to the Seymour Lieberman Exer-Trail, including surveying and schematic designs. Improved maintenance of the Park continued with the creation and execution of a new maintenance plan for the Living Bridge, and increased focus on established gardens within the Park, making use of both professionals and volunteers.##MASTER PLANNINGWorking in conjunction with HPARD and Uptown Houston TIRZ, MPC led the process to hire the master planning landscape architecture firm, Nelson Byrd Woltz. The selection process began in FY13. The firm was selected based on their successful experience with large-scale public projects and a keen focus on restoring damaged ecologies. The first six months of the Memorial Park Long-Range Master Planning process consisted of studies and analysis covering topics such as ecology, park use, regional cultural and ecological history, park traffic, security, parking, connectivity, and trends in Houston that will impact the requirements for the Park in the future. Knowing the passion that Houstonians have for Memorial Park, the Conservancy felt it was critical to conduct a robust public input process, conducted by objective, third-party professionals prior to initiating the Master Plan design process. The primary goal was to ensure that all Houstonians, park users, park neighbors, naturalists, conservationists, community groups, user groups and any Houstonian with an interest in the Park shape the future of Memorial Park. The secondary objective of this process was to help inform and educate the public on several topics, including the current state of the parks ecology and challenges the park will likely face in the future. MPC engaged a consulting firm to embed a visitor-focused perspective in the Master Planning process, specifically by helping the master planning team understand the current and future Houston market via an in-depth market study. Some of the information provided in the final report identifies concrete needs or improvements requested by Park users. The report is largely forward looking, providing an analysis of Houstons future market and multiple, city-wide opportunities that may be leveraged to ensure that the improved circulation, facilities, operations and programs serve a multiplicity of uses and elevate the quality of life for all Houstonians.##FORESTRY AND CONSERVATION The forestry and conservation program was enhanced through the hiring of new Conservation Director, Nick Butler. Nick is an ISA-certified Arborist and has a Forestry degree with Environmental Conservation emphasis from Mississippi State University and a Master's degree in Natural Resources from Utah State University. The Conservancy continued the ongoing invasive species and undergrowth removal program on over 200 acres, as well as managed the planting of over 90,000 seedlings of diverse species throughout the Parkthe largest planting in the Parks history. MPC also oversaw stump grinding on 23 acres, helping to prepare for future planting.","Memorial Park Conservancy (MPC) is dedicated to the preservation and enhancement of Memorial Park for today and for future generations; to public use, enjoyment and education in accordance with conditions of the conveyance to the City of Houston by the Hogg Family; and to the on-going support of the Houston Parks and Recreation Department (HPARD).",2.014428793493008e+17,11997466.0,990,11/20/2014 9:25:31 PM,MEMORIAL PARK CONSERVANCY INC,201405.0,2014.0,2014.0,5.0,7575 NORTH PICNIC LANE,2556953.0,,,HOUSTON,,,Z,Y,48201.0,2014.0,15.0,1.0,0.0,2088561.0,0.0,PC,S,ZA,C,C,3362.0,813219.0,MEMORIAL PARK CONSERVANCY INC,C,C113,,,1,,,,IN,,,3360.0,,200010.0,0.47763999999999995,,TX,3.0,201405.0,2014.0,N,77007.0,2556953.0,Y,bmf1412c3,201405.0,1979067.0,N,B,C1130,C,EN,EN,OT

93492318029304.0,237009662,EFILE,"Educational Outreach: The HRS welcomed visitors and members throughout the year at monthly meetings featuring lectures presented by speakers and other educational activities.The Society brought horticulture experts from New York, Louisiana and Texas to present programs on rose gardening, the treatment of plant diseases and pests, historical rose gardens, plant propagation, , varietal information and garden design. Industry experts presented programs on rose photography, chemical treatments for roses and new cultivar selection newly arrived to the commercial market. Consulting and Master rosarians from the Houston Rose Society, the Texas Rose Rustlers and the American Rose Society presented programs on pruning, the creation and marketing of mini-flora roses, plant propagation and the rose industry. In addition to featured speakers, the Societys continued its Grand Prix program (March November) that encouraged members to bring blooms from their gardens as a way to demonstrate cultivar varieties to the gardening public and Society members.HRS Board Members, Consulting and Master Rosarian members have given in excess of 25 programs on rose horticulture (in addition to the Society-presented monthly lectures) to (1) international horticulture events, (2) national horticulture events, (2) other local rose societies, (3) local, state and national garden clubs, (4) Master Gardener organizations, (5) customers at nursery-sponsored events, and (6) visitors to the American Rose Center and at other rose society gatherings at cities in Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida and Georgia.The Societys liaison with the Texas AgriLife Extension Service (part of Texas A&M University) presented a National Earth-Kind Outreach Program to students at the Texas A&M Landscape Architect School, educating the students on the Societys work with the university to develop environmentally sound landscape management practices for roses.Educational Activities: The Society hosted a community pruning demonstration, two rose shows and spring garden tours that were open to the general public and members at no charge. Additionally, the Society supported the American Rose Society South Central District Convention held in San Antonio, Texas which was attended by many of the Societys members.##Public Outreach: The Society created, maintains and/or has supposed public rose plantings in Texas and Louisiana, including two gardens at the American Rose Center in Shreveport, Louisiana. Society members also assisted as volunteers at the Houston Municipal Rose Garden until the garden was closed for renovation in July 2013. In addition, HRS Board Members (as well as some members) help maintain public rose plantings at several churches and schools in Harris and Dallas counties in Texas.In October, the Board approved sponsorship of a rose trial garden as part of a partnership with the Harris County Texas AgriLife Extension Service and a local hospital district. This plant trial will demonstrate to the public cultivars that can be maintained with no chemical inputs and reduced irrigation.Our Consulting and Master Rosarian members participated in local radio station gardening shows answering call-in questions on rose growing in the Houston area. One of the Societys Board Members traveled to Pennsylvania in September 2013 to serve as one of the key-note speakers at the International Plant Trials Conference discussing the Societys environmental rose research efforts to an audience of international plant breeders, public garden curators, horticulturalists, nursery professionals and college professors from around the world. Many of the Societys Consulting and Master Rosarians are also part of the American Rose Societys Cyber CR program answering questions about local rose care posed by gardeners around the country.One of the Societys Board Members made two presentations in 2013 to the American Camellia Society, discussing the Earth-Kind Plant Research Program sponsored by the Houston Rose Society and how that program has benefitted the rose industry and has consulted with that national horticultural organization on the development of a similar program at the American Camellia Gardens in Perry, Georgia.Part of the Societys public outreach comes from its affiliation and partnership with local nurseries. Through these affiliations, the Society was able to host a spring rose festival, a rose propagation clinic, and a number of pruning demonstrations at area nurseries throughout the year.Research and Education: The Houston Rose Society is the financial underwriter of the Earth-Kind Environmental Rose Research Program conducted by the Texas AgriLife Extension Service. As part of this research effort, the Society has 400 rose bushes under evaluation in a public planting in Farmers Branch, Texas and in Commerce, Texas in these multi-year studies. The horticulture research efforts sponsored by the Society have thus far yielded publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals, a book chapter in a peer-reviewed horticulture textbook, a research presentation to the Southern Nursery Association Research Conference and many industry and trade journals in addition to publication in the public media. The public demand and interest in environmentally responsible rose horticulture has allowed this research effort to be expanded to currently include 8 universities in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, New York, Louisiana and Arkansas and public gardens in Texas, New York, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska.In 2013, the Board convened a committee to investigate and make recommendation for the establishment of a Horticultural Scholarship Program that would provide an annual scholarship to deserving students of horticulture.##Published Educational Material: The Society publishes prints and distributes 7 different educational brochures on all aspects of rose horticulture. In 2013, approximately 7,000 of these brochures were distributed without charge to the public.An HRS Board Member co-authored a book chapter in a peer-reviewed scientific textbook, Floriculture & Ornamental Biotechnology (Global Science Books, 2009); a book chapter in The Sustainable Rose Garden A Reader in Rose Culture (Newbury Books, 2010); a book chapter in A Garden Book for Houston and the Texas Gulf Coast (River Oaks Garden Club, 2012); an abstract presented at the 2013 International Plant Trials Conference; an abstract presented at the 2012 American Society of Horticulture Science Conference; a research presentation to the rose industry at the Southern Nursery Association Research Conference; a research presentation to landscape design students at the Texas A&M Landscape Design School and educational brochures concerning the Societys Earth-Kind Rose Research Program. These brochures are being distributed by approximately 80 rose societies across the country.Educational articles written by HRS Board Members, Consulting and Master Rosarians have appeared in local and national magazines such as:The American RoseNM Pro (Nursery Management Professional an industry publication)HortScienceHortTechnologyLawn & LandscapeCowboys & IndiansThe American GardenerParks & Recreation BusinessMartha Stewart LivingReaders DigestChristian Science Monitorand in newspapers with local and national distribution, such as:Houston ChronicleNew York TimesAssociated Press (32 media markets nationwide)and by other rose societies and garden clubs including:The Houston Rose SocietyThe Greater Palm Beach Rose Society (Florida)The South Metro Rose Society (Georgia)The Linn County Rose Society (Iowa)The Manhattan Rose Society (New York)The Denver Rose Society (Colorado)The Southampton Rose Society (New York)The Central Florida Rose Society (Florida)The Jacksonville Rose Society (Florida)The Rose Society of Greater St. Lewis (Missouri)The Houston Federation of Garden ClubsThe Texas Rose RustlersThe CenLa Rose Society (Louisiana)The Greater Gwinnett Rose Society (Georgia)The West Jersey Rose Society (New Jersey)The Greater Cincinnati Rose Society (Ohio)The Central Louisiana Rose SocietyThe Cookeville Area Rose Society (Tennessee)The Gold Country Rose Society (California)The India Rose Society (Asia)Member articles have also been published by the Texas Nursery & Landscape Association.

More detailed management plans are prepared for properties as KPC undertakes preserve enhancement and restoration activities, including the restoration and creation of wetlands and the enhancement and replanting of native grasslands.##Public Policy and Stewardship - KPC works with various governmental entities to track and monitor public policy that may affect KPC's lands, including major thoroughfare and road plans, flood control initiatives, and conservation easement tax incentives. KPC also monitors its conservation easement lands on an annual basis to ensure that the goals and objectives of the legal agreement between KPC and the impacted landowner are followed and the land in question remains viable for its conservation values. KPC is working to establish more vigorous baseline data on all its preserves and to tract changes over time through regular monitoring protocols.Land Management and Restoration - During 2004-2005, KPC's Board of Directors approved securing a majority ownership of the historic Warren Ranch, a working cattle ranch. The Board determined that the continued operations of the Warren Ranch were part of KPC's mission to protect the unique scenic, historic and natural sites on the Katy Prairie. They noted that well-managed farmland shelters wildlife, supplies scenic open space, and helps filter impurities from our air and water and that these agricultural lands offer many other benefits as well: preservation of open space and natural resources; outdoor recreation, including bird watching, hiking, hunting, and nature tours; improved flood protection; economic development through eco-tourism; enhanced wildlife habitat; recharge zones for the area's aquifers; educational field trips for area youth, and research opportunities for colleges and universities in ecology and land management. The prairie also provides children who might not have an opportunity otherwise to visit a working ranch to ride a horse or tour a farm to see how food is produced - a distinctive outdoor experience.##Land Conservation - The Katy Prairie Conservancy (KPC) protects land on the Katy Prairie in the following ways: acquisition of conservation lands at fair market value, acquisition of conservation lands through a bargain sale arrangement, receipt of donated conservation lands to KPC, receipt of donated trade lands to KPC, donation of conservation easements to KPC, and purchase of development rights on conservation lands on the Katy Prairie. Conservation lands are held in permanent trust and are maintained for the benefit of both the wildlife that inhabit the lands and the public who enjoy visiting KPC's preserves.","Katy Prairie Conservancy (KPC) is dedicated to protecting a sustainable portion of the Katy Prairie for the benefit of its wildlife and the enjoyment of all Texans.

Marsh restoration maintains appropriate water depth and supports marsh vegetation, such as smooth cord grass and bulrushes replantings. Today this site is thriving, the largest restored marsh on the bayou.##Education: Over 8,500 students of all ages participate in ABNC educational programs annually. School groups participate in Texas Achievement and Knowledge Standards (TAKS) correlated outdoor classes, field trips, and programs featuring nature or historical subjects. ABNC offers outdoor nature camps each summer and winter, scout programs, and community outreaches and conducts numerous informal educational activities including: guided trail hikes, animal demonstrations, hands-on-history craft demonstrations, and guided canoe and pontoon boat bayou explorations.##Visitor & Member Services: Over 15,000 guests visit ABNC annually; another 2,100 member visits are recorded. Almost 4,000 people travel to ABNC for meetings or private events each year. Visitors follow the self-guided Discovery Trail interpretive loop; some venture out on over 5 miles of developed hiking trails. The education facilities and historical farm site offer 'special places' for family retreats, company meetings or seasonal parties. Several community groups utilize the ABNC meeting spaces and ABNC regularly hosts small nature-related conferences.",To preserve the habitats with which we have been entrusted and to provide opportunities for people to experience and understand the local ecosystems. Through preservation and education we strive to reconnect people with nature.,2.0142321934930243e+17,12140652.0,990,12/29/2014,ARMAND BAYOU NATURE CENTER INC,201312.0,2014.0,2013.0,12.0,PO BOX 58828,903560.0,,,HOUSTON,,,Z,Y,48201.0,2013.0,15.0,1.0,0.0,702290.0,0.0,PC,O,EN,C,C,3362.0,712190.0,ARMAND BAYOU NATURE CENTER INC,C,C60,,,1,,,,IN,,,3360.0,,197408.0,0.9807,,TX,3.0,201312.0,2014.0,N,77258.0,903560.0,Y,bmf1412c3,201312.0,665389.0,N,A,C60,C,EN,EN,OT

Each year, CEE's benchmark programs provide materials and training for more than 50,000 educators, who reach millions of young people with essential information about conservation and the environment. See below for a description of each of CEE's educational programs.Project WILD is a supplementary, interdisciplinary, instructional program for educators of students in kindergarten through high school that is balanced and fair, neither pro nor con on value-sensitive issues. Project WILD's mission is to provide wildlife-based conservation and environmental education that fosters responsible actions toward wildlife and related natural resources. The goal of Project WILD is to assist learners of any age in developing awareness, knowledge, skills and commitment to result in informed decisions, responsible behavior and constructive actions concerning wildlife and the environment upon which all life depends.The Flying WILD program engages middle schools in bird education efforts with the intent of encouraging increased environmental stewardship among youth. Special emphasis is placed on creating an approach that is readily adaptable for urban schools, often with underserved students who traditionally receive few opportunities to participate in environmental education initiatives.Growing Up WILD is an early childhood education program that builds on childrens sense of wonder about nature and invites them to explore wildlife and the world around them. Through a wide range of activities and experiences, Growing Up WILD provides an early foundation for developing positive impressions about the natural world and lifelong social and academic skills.WET in the City engages K-12 youth in hands-on activities that creatively explore the science of water, its cultural context, and complex issues surrounding its management and stewardship. The program is delivered at the local level and targets urban educators with relevant, localized water education.Team WET Schools is a companion program to WET in the City, bringing urban water issues to the forefront of environmental education in school buildings. A network of community and corporate partners grows around each Team WET School supporting teachers to advance water education while encouraging students to participate in active water stewardship and community improvement.",The Council for Environmental Educations mission is to provide environmental education programs and services that promote stewardship of the environment and further the capacity of learners to make informed decisions.,2.0154135934930675e+17,12806300.0,990,8/21/2015,WESTERN REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION COUNCIL DBA COUNCIL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ED,201406.0,2015.0,2014.0,6.0,5555 MORNINGSIDE DR STE 212,390714.0,,,HOUSTON,,,Z,Y,48201.0,2014.0,15.0,1.0,0.0,678940.0,0.0,PC,O,EN,C,C,3362.0,712190.0,WESTERN REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION COUNCIL,C,C60,,,1,,,,IN,,,3360.0,,198402.0,0.64275,COUNCIL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION,TX,3.0,201406.0,2015.0,N,77005.0,390714.0,Y,bmf1512c3,201406.0,559647.0,N,B,C60,C,EN,EN,OT

Our education and outreach programs occur in a wide variety of formats and reach diverse audiences. During the tax year, TALT's outreach efforts included: a ""Saving Family Lands"" workshop for landowners and their advisors in San Antonio; MCLE presentations given to landowners and attorneys in Midland, Victoria, Amarillo, Lubbock and Fort Worth; A one-day conference, entitled No Land, No Water, at the State Capitol on funding for land conservation; TALT hosted a two day Conservation Finance Network Summit in Houston, Texas focusing on developing funding sources for conservation easements. A second one day summit was held in Austin to further develop funding sources; and TALT partnered with National Fish and Wildlife in a program to communicate with landowners about using the conservation easement to protect certain tall grass prairie wildlife. This included a seminar in Lubbock to communicate how conservation easements can be used to protect the Lesser Prairie Chicken. Through the use of its newsletter, social media and speaking engagements, TALT educates an urban audience regarding the public benefits of rural working lands.##Conservation easements to protect working lands: TALT partners with landowners who seek donated conservation easements, purchase of development rights, and mitigation banks. TALT staff provides professional, efficient, responsive and experienced service for the negotiations of conservation easements. TALT's processes have been developed over the past eight years and incorporate best management practices from the Land Trust Alliance (LTA) and from members of the partnership of rangeland trusts. At the end of the tax year, TALT held conservation easements on nearly 225,000 acres of Texas farms and ranches throughout the state. TALT today is the largest state-based land trust in Texas and numbers among in the top 15 regional or state wide land trusts in the country according to a recent LTA census.","The mission of the Texas Agricultural Land Trust (TALT) is to conserve the Texas heritage of agricultural lands, natural resources and wildlife habitats. TALT works to sustain the long-term stewardship of private lands for the benefit of all Texans. TALT accomplishes its mission through the use of voluntary conservation measures and through education and outreach efforts. TALT partners with private landowners to negotiate and transact conservation easements that protect important conservation values, in accordance with IRC Section 170(h). These privately stewarded lands provide public benefits such as productive agricultural lands, scenic views, drinking water protection, natural wildlife habitat and open space. Additionally, with a state that holds 94% privately owned lands, TALT works to educate the public on the many public benefits provided by the stewardship of private lands, and to educate Texas landowners about the use of conservation easements.

School groups participate in Texas Achievement and Knowledge Standards (TAKS) correlated outdoor classes, field trips, and programs featuring nature or historical subjects. ABNC offers outdoor nature camps each summer and winter, scout programs, and community outreaches and conducts numerous informal educational activities including: guided trail hikes, animal demonstrations, hands-on-history craft demonstrations, and guided canoe and pontoon boat bayou explorations.##Stewardship: ABNC preserves one of the most extensive holdings of coastal tall-grass prairie in the lower Galveston Bay watershed. Currently, 900 acres are actively managed within our current boundaries. Prairie lands are being restored through controlled burns and mowing to reduce invasive species and by replanting native grasses. ABNC also manages 300 acres of Texas Coastal Preserve in the Armand Bayou watershed. Marsh restoration maintains appropriate water depth and supports marsh vegetation, such as smooth cord grass and bulrushes replantings. Today this site is thriving, the largest restored marsh on the bayou.##Visitor & Member Services: Over 15,000 guests visit ABNC annually; another 2,100 member visits are recorded. Almost 4,000 people travel to ABNC for meetings or private events each year. Visitors follow the self-guided Discovery Trail interpretive loop; some venture out on over 5 miles of developed hiking trails.

KPC also monitors its conservation easement lands on an annual basis to ensure that the goals and objectives of the legal agreement between KPC and the impacted landowner are followed and the land in question remains viable for its conservation values. KPC is working to establish more vigorous baseline data on all its preserves and to tract changes over time through regular monitoring protocols.Land Management and Restoration - During 2004-2005, KPC's Board of Directors approved securing a majority ownership of the historic Warren Ranch, a working cattle ranch. The Board determined that the continued operations of the Warren Ranch were part of KPC's mission to protect the unique scenic, historic and natural sites on the Katy Prairie. They noted that well-managed farmland shelters wildlife, supplies scenic open space, and helps filter impurities from our air and water and that these agricultural lands offer many other benefits as well: preservation of open space and natural resources; outdoor recreation, including bird watching, hiking, hunting, and nature tours; improved flood protection; economic development through eco-tourism; enhanced wildlife habitat; recharge zones for the area's aquifers; educational field trips for area youth, and research opportunities for colleges and universities in ecology and land management. The prairie also provides children who might not otherwise have an opportunity to visit a working ranch to ride a horse or tour a farm to see how food is produced - a distinctive outdoor experience.","Long-term goals are to: protect 50,000 acres; allow public access; ensure responsible stewardship of protected lands; restore and enhance wildlife habitat; offer educational programs; and conduct and facilitate appropriate research to accomplish KPCs mission.","Land Conservation - The Katy Prairie Conservancy (KPC) protects land on the Katy Prairie in the following ways: acquisition of conservation lands at fair market value, acquisition of conservation lands through a bargain sale arrangement, receipt of donated conservation lands to KPC, receipt of donated trade lands to KPC, donation of conservation easements to KPC, and purchase of development rights on conservation lands on the Katy Prairie. Conservation lands are held in permanent trust and are maintained for the benefit of both the wildlife that inhabit the lands and the public who enjoy visiting KPC's preserves.##Public Policy and Stewardship - KPC works with various governmental entities to track and monitor public policy that may affect KPC's lands, including major thoroughfare and road plans, flood control initiatives, and conservation easement tax incentives.

After years of being the sole woman involved in energy transactions, Women's Energy Network's founder believed that many women energy professionals were in the same position, but unable to connect with each other. Years later, the Women's Energy Network remains committed to providing high caliber events and networking to its diverse membership from across the energy value chain. WEN Houston also sponsors new chapters and retains some of the membership fees for support.##Education and Networking - Luncheons, special events, webinars: Each month Women's Energy Network hosts luncheons for 80-150 members and guests featuring exceptional leaders in energy or other relevant businesses. Guests are also welcome. Women's Energy Network offers growth opportunities to its members through participation on its Board of Directors and special programs. Women's Energy Network is based on the model of the premier women's leadership development program, Leadership Texas, which focuses on networking, education, and community. This includes all Houston area luncheons (energy corridor, downtown, and north side), webinars, and special events such as the 20th Anniversary celebration, partnership events, wine tasting, networking event, fashion events, etc.##YWE: WEN's signature program, Young Women Energized, introduces high school girls to the energy industry and holds an annual event for them to engage with professional women and learn about various careers in the industry.

During Spring Migration, the globally important High Island and Bolivar Flats coastal sanctuaries welcomed 6,000 visitors from 45 states and 20 countries this year. HAS staff and dedicated volunteers manage its sanctuaries with a focus on habitat restoration, invasive species control, bird monitoring and protection, and public access enhancement. In addition, HAS works with communities and partner organizations to improve native habitats for birds throughout the greater Houston area. This year HAS expanded its Natives Nursery, making native wildflowers and grasses available to partners for urban demonstration gardens, pocket prairies, and local gardeners wishing to enhance landscapes to benefit wildlife.##ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION & OUTREACH: This year HAS provided 874 innovative natural science program experiences to over 36,000 children and adults at its two urban nature centers and through its extensive programming taken on the road throughout the Houston-Galveston area. Program offerings included nature camps, school outreach programs, and scout workshops for children as well as birding classes, field trips and citizen science bird monitoring programs for all ages. In addition, HAS expanded its reach in two ways: 1) through virtual fieldtrips hosted from the Sims Bayou Urban Nature Center, making available live bird conservation educational presentations to schools across the U.S., Canada and Mexico; and 2) by bringing the birds and bird education to residents at Alzheimers and memory care facilities though a new program called Bird Tales.",The vision of Houston Audubon Society (HAS) is the creation of a healthier natural environment and a more beautiful place to live by leading and nurturing a community that values and supports birds.,2.015413493493001e+17,12701375.0,990,7/22/2015,HOUSTON AUDUBON SOCIETY INC,201406.0,2015.0,2014.0,6.0,440 WILCHESTER BLVD,6862195.0,,,HOUSTON,,,Z,Y,48201.0,2014.0,16.0,1.0,0.0,2315479.0,0.0,PC,O,EN,C,C,3362.0,813312.0,HOUSTON AUDUBON SOCIETY,C,C30,,,1,,,,IN,,,3360.0,,197001.0,0.35511,,TX,3.0,201406.0,2015.0,N,77079.0,6862195.0,Y,bmf1512c3,201406.0,1909454.0,N,A,C30,C,EN,EN,OT

The Grand Gateway, the historic main entrance to Hermann Park, will benefit from extensive landscaping surrounding the Sam Houston Monument and Mecom Fountain. Improved walkways, pedestrian-scale lighting, benches, bike racks, and new drainage and irrigation will be added to the stretch of parkland from the Mecom Fountain to Cambridge Street. Groundbreaking for the McGovern Centennial Gardens in September 2013 marked the start of the $31 million project to transform Hermann Parks 15-acre Garden Center into the McGovern Centennial Gardens. The Gardens will feature a rose garden, an arid garden, an interactive family garden, a great lawn, a woodland garden, a 30-foot garden mount and a sculpture promenade. Construction also began on the Cherie Flores Garden Pavilion designed by the architecture firm Bohlin Cywinski Jackson. The new building will act as a main gateway to the McGovern Centennial Gardens and provide rental space, along with the Celebration Garden, for the Houston community. Hermann Parks Japanese Garden was improved with the aid of a professional garden team from Japan, led by gardener Hiroshi Iwasaki. The focus was on tree and shrub pruning and trimming in true Japanese style, fence building, and design for specific areas of the garden.##Visitor Services The Visitor Services department was developed in 2008 when Hermann Park Conservancy was awarded the contract by the City of Houston to manage the Hermann Park train. Specifically, Visitor Services oversees and operates Hermann Park train and the pedal boats, and coordinates activities with the Conservancy gift shop, cafe, and food vendors. The 10 to 15 member staff are responsible for creating an exciting and memorable experience for park visitors and to ensure Lake Plaza is operating efficiently and safely. Additionally, its maintenance team is responsible for the cleaning and upkeep of Lake Plaza.##Park Programs and Maintenance The Conservancys maintenance program assists the Houston parks department with the maintenance of Hermann Park. Responsibilities include maintaining and cleaning the parks grounds, water areas, and hardscapes; planting and watering trees; and weeding. The Volunteer and Education department supports maintenance, horticulture, and reforestation efforts, while engaging the public in community building, teaching valuable skills, and imparting knowledge about the park.",Hermann Park Conservancy is a citizens' organization dedicated to the stewardship and improvement of Hermann Park - today and for generations to come.,2.0150126934930064e+17,12638757.0,990,7/6/2015,HERMANN PARK CONSERVANCY,201406.0,2015.0,2014.0,6.0,6201 A HERMANN PARK DRIVE,33380470.0,,,HOUSTON,,,Z,Y,48201.0,2014.0,15.0,1.0,0.0,13090622.0,0.0,PC,O,EN,C,C,3362.0,813312.0,HERMANN PARK CONSERVANCY,C,C50,,,1,,,,IN,,,3360.0,,199104.0,0.51473,,TX,3.0,201406.0,2015.0,N,77030.0,33380470.0,Y,bmf1512c3,201406.0,7412836.0,N,A,C50,C,EN,EN,OT

Collectively, we opened the new Running Trails Center to the public in 2014. As the newest public building in Memorial Park in more than twenty years, the Center features lockers and showers for the use of runners, bicyclists and other park visitors along with vending machines and office space for the Conservancy. The Center provides much-needed additional parking for park visitors, a project which benefitted greatly from support from the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. Other essential projects that were recently completed include the refurbishment of the popular Seymour Lieberman Exer-Trail in collabortion with Uptown Houston TIRZ, as well as the rehabilitation of the natural surface trails on the south side of the Park.##PARK CARENatural resource management and maintenance of Memorial Park are the most labor intensive of the many needs of this urban Park. This care is delivered through Memorial Park Conservancy (MPC) programs and staff in conjunction with the Houston Parks and Recreation Department (HPARD). This years conservation program included convening an Eco-Tech panel of area experts that met frequently throughout the year to address and find solutions for ecological issues within the Park, treating approximately 415 acres for invasive species as well as site preparation of a portion of the treated acreage to prepare for the forestry and conservation projects identified by the Memorial Park Master Plan. The Conservancy also conducted an in-depth tree inventory to build on existing landscaped areas inventory and as well as habitat assessment in select locations. In addition to ecological care of the natural environment, sensitive maintenance has been the focus of the Conservancys volunteer and community outreach program. Through this program, more than 3,300 volunteer hours were contributed in 2014 toward the rehabilitation and beautification of the Park, all while working alongside professional staff and avocational horticulturists such as Master Naturalists and Master Gardeners. In addition to work inside Memorial Park, staff went out into the Houston community, speaking to various groups to continue to educate others on the needs of the Park. Additionally, we again engaged with current and prospective supporters through our annual events such as the Green Gala, Golf Tournament and the Brunch Run, which brought more than 1,800 runners to the Park. Finally, the Conservancy provided the financial resources to HPARD to hire two full-time maintenance workers in the Park, improving the day-to-day care and user experience.##MASTER PLANNINGWorking in conjunction with HPARD and Uptown Houston TIRZ (Uptown), MPC continued the Parks master planning process with landscape architecture firm Nelson Byrd Woltz, culminating in passing of the plan in April 2015 by Houston City Council. The master planning team facilitated studies and analysis covering topics such as ecology, park use, cultural and ecological history, traffic, security, parking, connectivity and trends in Houston that will impact the requirements for the Park in the future. MPC also contracted with ETM & Associates, nationally recognized experts in public space and park management, to provide a comprehensive plan for maintaining proposed projects of the Master Plan. The Conservancy continued to build and strengthen internal infrastructure to prepare for implementation of the Master Plan and a supporting Capital Campaign. In 2014 this included hiring additional staff, bringing the total number of staff to seven full-time employees. Board governance and structure continued to be strengthened. Park users and interested public were provided increased opportunities to communicate with the Conservancy and learn about Memorial Park through enhanced social media campaigns, print and electronic newsletters, and publication of the annual report.","Memorial Park Conservancy (MPC) is dedicated to the preservation and enhancement of Memorial Park for today and for future generations; to public use, enjoyment and education in accordance with conditions of the conveyance to the City of Houston.",2.015128693493002e+17,13093928.0,990,01/08/2016,MEMORIAL PARK CONSERVANCY INC,201505.0,2016.0,2015.0,5.0,7575 N PICNIC,1939810.0,,,HOUSTON,,,Z,Y,48201.0,2015.0,15.0,1.0,0.0,1694621.0,0.0,PC,S,ZA,C,C,3360.0,813219.0,MEMORIAL PARK CONSERVANCY INC,C,C113,,,,,,,IN,,,,,200010.0,0.58675,,TX,3.0,201505.0,2016.0,N,77007.0,1939810.0,Y,bmf1608c3,201505.0,1518538.0,N,B,C1130,C,EN,EN,OT

Trained citizen scientists augment professional monitoring data and aid in watershed planning through GBFs Water Monitoring Team, Bacteria Sampling Program, and Water Quality Internships. In 2014, the Water Monitoring Team grew to 53 volunteers who sampled from 52 sites, including 18 who sampled for Enterococcus bacteria from 20 sites. The Foundation is actively engaged in discussion and planning on improving coastal resiliency and also advocates for the allocation of research dollars to the region to ensure the health of Galveston Bay and its users.",The Galveston Bay Foundation works to ensure a clean and healthy Galveston Bay that can be enjoyed by people today and for generations to come. Our diverse programs preserve and protect Texas largest and most productive estuary.,"Conservation programs focus on estuarine habitat preservation, protection, and restoration. Land preservation work included closing on the purchases of the 17.23-acre Cedar Gully property and the 30.975-acre Cotton Bayou property, both in Chambers County, and obtaining conservation easements on the 178-acre Exploration Green tract in Harris County and the 1,100-acre Lone Pine Farm tract in Brazoria County. GBF committed Knobloch funds to members of the Partnership for Gulf Coast Land Conservation to help pay for due diligence costs associated with 13 land acquisition projects targeting Deepwater Horizon settlement funds for the conservation of more than 42,200 acres across all 5 Gulf states. Habitat restoration work included removing 3 derelict and abandoned steel barges from Cedar Bayou; completing work on the Pine Gully Wetlands Restoration project by constructing a pair of jetties at the mouth of the gully, dredging sediments out of the gully, and planting the banks with smooth cordgrass to restore about 2.5 acres of wetlands; and installing oyster bags along the shorelines of the Sweetwater Nature Preserve, including 80 feet along Sweetwater Lake and 55 feet along West Bay. We continued to recycle oyster shell from Tommys Oyster Bar, Topwater Grill, the Kemah Boardwalk, Crazy Alans Swamp Shack, and Number 13 at Pelican Rest Marina, reclaiming an estimated 127.8 tons of shell during 2014. We completed construction on one private landowner living shoreline project and began construction on another. We also hosted community-based habitat enhancement events including TPWDs annual Abandoned Crab Trap Removal event at the Fort Anahuac Park site, in which we removed 273 crab traps (over 80% of the total traps collected in/around Galveston Bay) with the assistance of 40 volunteers, 8 airboats, and 4 outboard boats; Trash Bash at Bay Area Park, with 832 volunteers collecting an estimated 7.5 tons of trash and recyclables from the Armand Bayou watershed; and Marsh Mania events involving 403 volunteers in planting 4.63 acres of estuarine inter tidal marsh at 5 restoration sites.##Education programs provide science-based environmental education focused on Galveston Bay. Our education programs allowed GBF to reach thousands of youth and adults in 2014. We hosted the Bay Day Festival at the Kemah Boardwalk, with 33 exhibits, support from 30 volunteers, participation by 120 kids in the Blue Crab Scavenger Hunt, and an estimated attendance of over 5,000 visitors; and the eighth annual Bike Around the Bay sponsored by Shell with more than 1,000 registered riders. We concluded the 2013-14 Get Hip to Habitat year by serving 1,100 students at 18 schools and kicked off the 2014-15 school year with participation by 22 schools. We installed an additional 46 seafood consumption advisory signs at 23 fishing and crabbing locations on local waters, ranging from the upper Houston Ship Channel at Brays Bayou down to Upper Galveston Bay in La Porte, and cemented 180 storm drain medallions at storm drain openings on the east end of Galveston Island in the residential areas south of UTMB with the help of Ball High School students. We launched the Dockwalker pilot program, which concluded that about half of the boaters surveyed at six marinas did not know the consequences of illegally discharging sewage overboard, justifying the need for continued education about the impacts of boater waste on the bay, and kicked off the Galveston Bay Report Card project, beginning with input about bay health topics obtained from more than 540 member and public surveys and 31 presentations to 800 individuals from various stakeholder groups. We also debuted a new website and mobile-friendly e-news format in 2014.##Advocacy programs attempt to balance the multiple uses of Galveston Bay so that the long-term interests of the Bay itself are not compromised. As a result of the Texas City Y Oil Spill in March 2014, GBF was activated as the Volunteer Coordinator and managed the Sentinel Program for 17 days, mobilizing 230 volunteers in walking 100 miles of Galveston beachfront looking for incidences of oil and oiled wildlife. GBF provided eight Rain Barrel Workshops in Baytown, Dickinson, Galveston, Houston, La Porte, and Nassau Bay, with 507 people in attendance and 517 rain barrels and kits distributed, reducing a potential of 540,000 gallons of storm water runoff and conserving water for Galveston Bay. GBF advocated for more meaningful water conservation goals in the City of Houston by making written comments on the draft 2014 City of Houston Water Conservation Plan, authoring a Houston Chronicle op-ed that generated an editorial and front page article, and addressing Mayor Annise Parker and City Council members. We cultivated partnerships with members of the Gulf Coast Water Efficiency Network by leading the efforts to launch a water conservation yard sign campaign targeting discretionary outdoor water use and advocated for environmental and water conservation considerations to be included during the rule making process of House Bill 4/State Water Implementation Fund for Texas (SWIFT) through oral and written comments to Texas Water Development Board. We continued Clean Water Partnerships with 19 marinas, 2 schools, and 4 cities, including a new partnership with the City of La Porte. Our volunteer Wetland Permit Review Committee reviewed 45 applications for Corps of Engineers permits and provided letters of concern or comments on 20 of them.","The mission of the Galveston Bay Foundation is to preserve, protect, and enhance the natural resources of the Galveston Bay estuarine system and its tributaries for present users and for posterity.",2.015031593493018e+17,13157582.0,990,01/28/2016,GALVESTON BAY FOUNDATION INC,201412.0,2016.0,2014.0,12.0,1100 HERCULES AVE STE 200,3650321.0,,,HOUSTON,,,Z,Y,48201.0,2014.0,15.0,1.0,0.0,4684279.0,0.0,PC,O,EN,C,C,3360.0,813312.0,GALVESTON BAY FOUNDATION,C,C32,,,,,,,IN,,,,,198805.0,0.38998,,TX,3.0,201412.0,2016.0,N,77058.0,3650321.0,Y,bmf1608c3,201412.0,4619660.0,N,A,C32,C,EN,EN,OT

Today, in every area, our sustainable story dominates civic discussion. We have slowly changed the direction of the City and region, and will continue to capitalize on these gains to realize a vision we know from surveys is shared by the people of Houston. Houston Tomorrow promotes sustainable development of our regions built environment. How we build infrastructure and other facilities impacts whether our citizens have access to quality food and water; to streets that are safe for all users; to greenspaces and parks; to walkable neighborhoods, to a healthier lifestyle, and to a choice of transportation types that includes walking, biking, driving, and transit. (Continued below.)##Houston Tomorrow works to align public spending and policies with citizen priorities to distribute scarce infrastructure money in a balanced way among transit, road repair, bike and pedestrian facilities, and new roads. We address issues of equity and work to bring meaningful equity to regional decision making on transportation funding and planning for the future of all our communities. Houston Tomorrow recognizes that the built environment in our 134 towns and cities is an investment that needs to be maintained and improved, and advocates for sustainable development in many neighborhoods in these existing places, rather than in natural and agricultural lands at the edges of the region. (continued below)##Houston Tomorrow is recognized as a trusted, independent information source that provides research, analysis, and best practices to keep citizens, policymakers, and business leaders informed about sustainable development. We do this broadly through our website, newsletter, ongoing public events, incisive presentations, input to the policy making process, and white papers and publications. Houston Tomorrow tackles big issues that other organizations are unwilling or unable to address, and thus stands alone in Houston as the primary proponent of broad principles for sustainable development that improves the environment, community,and economy.","Our mission is to improve the quality of life for all the people of the Houston region.

93492313007295.0,237009662,EFILE,"Educational Outreach: The HRS welcomed visitors and members throughout the year at monthly meetings featuring lectures presented by speakers and other educational activities.The Society brought horticulture experts from New Jersey and Texas to present programs on rose gardening, the treatment of plant diseases and pests, public and private rose gardens, breeding and hybridization, water conservation, integrated pest management, companion plants, competitive rose exhibition and varietal information. Industry experts presented programs on chemical treatments for roses and pesticide safety. Consulting and Master rosarians from the Houston Rose Society, the Texas Rose Rustlers and the American Rose Society presented programs on pruning and rose hybridization. In addition to featured speakers, the Society's continued its Grand Prix program (March November) that encouraged members to bring blooms from their gardens as a way to demonstrate cultivar varieties to the gardening public and Society members.HRS Board Members, Consulting and Master Rosarian members have given in excess of 20 programs on rose horticulture (in addition to the Society-presented monthly lectures) to (1) national horticulture events, (2) other local rose societies, (3) local, state and national garden clubs, (4) Master Gardener organizations, (5) customers at nursery-sponsored events, and (6) visitors to the American Rose Center and at other rose society gatherings at cities in Texas, Oklahoma and Minnesota. Board members have also published a number of rose horticulture podcasts in collaboration with local plant nurseries.The Societys liaison with the Texas AgriLife Extension Service (part of Texas A&M University) presented a National Earth-Kind Outreach Program to students at the Texas A&M Landscape Architect School, educating the students on the Societys work with the university to develop environmentally sound landscape management practices for roses.Educational Activities: The Society hosted a community pruning demonstration, a rose show and spring garden tours that were open to the general public and members at no charge. Additionally, the Society supported the American Rose Society Fall National Convention held in Tyler, Texas which was attended by many of the Societys members and members of the Board of Directors presented educational programs at this national event.##Public Outreach: The Society created, maintains and/or has supposed public rose plantings in Texas and Louisiana, including two gardens at the American Rose Center in Shreveport, Louisiana and rose plantings at the University of Texas Medical Branch - MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. Society members also consulted with landscape designers regarding the renovation of the Houston Municipal Rose Garden . In addition, HRS Board Members (as well as some members) help maintain public rose plantings at several churches and schools in Harris and Dallas counties in Texas.The Society also sponsors and maintains a rose trial garden as part of a partnership with the Harris County Texas AgriLife Extension Service and a local hospital district. This plant trial will demonstrate to the public cultivars that can be maintained with no chemical inputs and reduced irrigation.Our Consulting and Master Rosarian members participated in local radio station gardening shows answering call-in questions on rose growing in the Houston area. One of the Societys Board Members traveled to Minnesota to serve as the key-note speaker at the Twin Cities Rose Club annual dinner to discuss the Houston Rose Societys environmental rose research efforts to an audience of gardeners and rose society members. While in Minnesota, presentations were made on the same topics at the University of Wisconsin - River Falls' horticulture department with the audience being freshmen students, plant breeders, public garden curators, horticulturalists, nursery professionals and college professors from the northern U.S. Many of the Societys Consulting and Master Rosarians are also part of the American Rose Societys Cyber CR program answering questions about local rose care posed by gardeners around the country.Part of the Societys public outreach comes from its affiliation and partnership with local nurseries. Through these affiliations, the Society was able to host a spring rose festival, a rose propagation clinic, and a number of pruning demonstrations at area nurseries throughout the year.Research and Education: The Houston Rose Society is the financial underwriter of the Earth-Kind Environmental Rose Research Program conducted by the Texas AgriLife Extension Service. As part of this research effort, the Society had 400 rose bushes under evaluation in a public planting in Farmers Branch, Texas and in Commerce, Texas in these multi-year studies. The Society also sponsors a rose research trial at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas and the trial site was open to the public for educational tours in the spring of 2014. The horticulture research efforts sponsored by the Society have thus far yielded publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals, a book chapter in a peer-reviewed horticulture textbook, a research presentation to the Southern Nursery Association Research Conference and many industry and trade journals in addition to publication in the public media. The public demand and interest in environmentally responsible rose horticulture has allowed this research effort to be expanded to currently include 8 universities in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, New York, Louisiana and Arkansas and public gardens in Texas, New York, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska.In 2014, the Board created a Horticultural Scholarship Program that provides an annual scholarship to deserving students of horticulture. The first scholarship grant was awarded in the fall of 2014.##Published Educational Material: The Society publishes prints and distributes 7 different educational brochures on all aspects of rose horticulture.

It is the Foundations practice that a sectarian organization must be listed in the Official Catholic Directory. Of these sectarian grants, about 70% are made in the South Texas area which includes the Diocese of Brownsville, the Diocese of Corpus Christi, and the Diocese of Laredo. Education has been strongly favored in recent grant giving cycles including tuition assistance for Catholic schools, and scholarships for Catholic and public universities. Service organizations and Catholic charities which target health, human services, the indigent, equal opportunity, and service to others are also favored. By continually evoking the Foundations core values when making grant decisions, the Foundation is able to help countless numbers of people.##The Foundation has established a museum in the historic Kenedy Pasture Company building in the township of Sarita, Texas.

The gardens feature a rose garden, a family garden, an arid garden, a great lawn, a woodland garden and a 30-foot garden mount giving visitors a panoramic view of the entire garden. The Cherie Flores Garden Pavilion, designed by the architecture firm Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, serves as the gateway to the gardens and is also a rental facility for the community. In FY15, planning began for the restoration of Hermann Parks historic clubhouse, built in 1933. Once complete, the clubhouse will function as a rental facility securing earned income to supplement the Conservancys maintenance program for the Park. Planning and fundraising was also underway for a renovation of the Japanese Garden ahead of its 25th anniversary in 2017. In addition to structural improvements to be made by the City of Houston, the Conservancy began planning for specialty projects for the garden including a new Japanese-style gate on the Fannin Street side to make the garden more accessible.##Visitor Services - The Visitor Services department was developed in 2008 when Hermann Park Conservancy was awarded the contract by the City of Houston to manage the Hermann Park Railroad. Visitor Services oversees and operates the train and pedal boats and coordinates activities with the Conservancy Gift Shop, Pinewood Cafe, and food vendors throughout the Park. Visitor Services manages facility rentals for events at the new Cherie Flores Garden Pavilion and Celebration Garden in the McGovern Centennial Gardens. The department hosts special programs at Lake Plaza including a yearly birthday party for Park namesake, George Hermann, a holiday party with arts and crafts and other activities, and student performances. Approximately 25 staff members are responsible for creating an exciting and memorable experience for Park visitors and keep Lake Plaza operating efficiently and safely. The maintenance team is responsible for the cleaning and upkeep of Lake Plaza.##Park Programs and Maintenance The Conservancys maintenance program assists the Houston Parks and Recreation Department with the maintenance of Hermann Park. Responsibilities include maintaining and cleaning the Parks grounds, water areas, and hardscapes; planting and watering trees; and weeding. The Conservancy has taken on the maintenance program for the 15-acre McGovern Centennial Gardens and parking area that opened in December 2014. A team of 12 full- and part-time gardeners and maintenance workers keep the gardens and landscaped parking lot in top condition, ensuring that the gardens are well tended through each season. The volunteer program supports the McGovern Centennial Gardens staff as well as lending a hand throughout the Park. Volunteers are involved with Park maintenance, horticulture and reforestation efforts and create a connection between the Park and the community.",Hermann Park Conservancy is a citizens' organization dedicated to the stewardship and improvement of Hermann Park - today and for generations to come.,2.016106993493001e+17,13636156.0,990,07/20/2016,HERMANN PARK CONSERVANCY,201506.0,2016.0,2015.0,6.0,6201 A HERMANN PARK DRIVE,26355247.0,,,HOUSTON,,,Z,Y,48201.0,2014.0,15.0,1.0,0.0,13847232.0,0.0,PC,O,EN,C,C,3360.0,813312.0,HERMANN PARK CONSERVANCY,C,C50,,,,,,,IN,,,,,199104.0,0.24811999999999998,,TX,3.0,201506.0,2016.0,N,77030.0,26355247.0,Y,bmf1608c3,201506.0,6601388.0,N,A,C50,C,EN,EN,OT

See below for a description of each of CEE's educational programs.Project WILD is a supplementary, interdisciplinary, instructional program for educators of students in kindergarten through high school that is balanced and fair, neither pro nor con on value-sensitive issues. Project WILD's mission is to provide wildlife-based conservation and environmental education that fosters responsible actions toward wildlife and related natural resources. The goal of Project WILD is to assist learners of any age in developing awareness, knowledge, skills and commitment to result in informed decisions, responsible behavior and constructive actions concerning wildlife and the environment upon which all life depends.The Flying WILD program engages middle schools in bird education efforts with the intent of encouraging increased environmental stewardship among youth. Special emphasis is placed on creating an approach that is readily adaptable for urban schools, often with underserved students who traditionally receive few opportunities to participate in environmental education initiatives.Growing Up WILD is an early childhood education program that builds on childrens sense of wonder about nature and invites them to explore wildlife and the world around them. Through a wide range of activities and experiences, Growing Up WILD provides an early foundation for developing positive impressions about the natural world and lifelong social and academic skills.WET in the City engages K-12 youth in hands-on activities that creatively explore the science of water, its cultural context, and complex issues surrounding its management and stewardship.

93492137043136.0,472453835,EFILE,"Building capacity in the conservation community -- C2S2 conducted its first training course on the value and uniqueness of large-sized, conservation breeding centers, Conservation Breeding Centers for Wildlife Sustainability. Instructors from various C2S2 member institutions shared insight on wide ranging topics in wildlife conservation breeding and infrastructure, collaborative land use and natural resource management, research tools and techniques, new models for large-scale sustainability, and multiple case studies for diverse species. Significant time was spent outside the classroom exploring the landscapes, facilities, and operations. The Source Population Alliance (SPA) meta-population saw a 40% increase in total animals since the beginning of the year. In January 2015, the SPA Executive Committee met at Fossil Rim Wildlife Center for a business planning meeting, which included discussions and determinations on budgetary needs and funding mechanisms for the program. Based on the survey results and these discussions, the top service/research priority for SPA participants was genomics testing, which will provide participants new information on animal relatedness and the genetic value of individuals. Animals that are over-represented or under-represented in the meta-populations can be identified and appropriate breeding recommendations made. Samples from more than 280 individual animals (44% of the meta-population) across the four species have been provided by participants for genomics testing. Critical knowledge of whooping crane reproductive biology and behavior was generated through studies on mate choice, hormone analysis, and sperm cryopreservation at SCBI and the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, and initial results were presented at the C2S2 Annual Meeting. Cheetah Sustainability Program- Multiple facilities in the Breeding Centers Coalition had double digit cheetah births this year. The Breeding Centers Coalition (BCC) has assembled the most genetically valuable cheetahs from the Species Survival Program (SSP) into the significant animal space of the nine BCC institutions. Six of the latter are Full Members of C2S2. Monthly BCC conference calls were held to promote knowledge sharing and to address breeding challenges.During 2014 and 2015, 18 cheetah cubs were born at Fossil Rim Wildlife Center, 16 were born at San Diego Zoo Global, and 13 were born at White Oak Conservation. In 2015, six new breeder cheetahs (two males, four females) contributed offspring to the CSP. The collective BCC now manages more than 160 cheetahs, with an average of four additional cheetahs transferred to each BCC institution over the last two years.",To provide leadership in studying and creating self-sustaining populations 'ex situ' and 'in situ' of endangered species,,,,,,,2.0163137934920432e+17,13833563.0,990EZ,10/03/2016,CONSERVATION CENTERS FOR SPECIES SURVIVAL,201512.0,2016.0,2015.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IT HAS ADVOCATED VIGOROUSLY AGAINST AERIAL SPRAYING OF THE HERBICIDE IMAZAPYR BY THE U.S. BORDER PATROL ON OR NEAR THE RIVER, WHERE IT REPRESENTS A HAZARD TO HUMANS AND RIVER WILDLIFE. RGISC ALSO BROUGHT ATTENTION TO THE NEAR DESTRUCTION OF A CRITICAL INNER CITY WETLAND AT LAKE CASA BLANCA BY ACQUIRING 13,000 SIGNATURES AND HOLDING COUNTLESS MEETING WITH CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS, AND THE U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS. IN JANUARY 2013, THE CITY COUNCIL EVENTUALLY VOTED TO SELL ALL OF THIS LAND FOR DEVELOPMENT WITH VERY LITTLE BEING PRESERVED AS A WETLAND FEATURE. MANADAS CREEK & WETLAND RESTORATION PROJECT ON A BRANCH OF MANADAS CREEK, NEAR THE INTERSECTION OF I-35 AND MINES ROAD, LIES ONE OF LAREDO'S LAST REMAINING WETLANDS. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS ISOLATED AND FRAGILE ECO-SYSTEM HAS BECOME THE RESTING PLACE FOR TONS OF TRASH FROM RAIN EVENTS, AND HUNDREDS OF SHOPPING CARTS FROM THE NORTH CREEK SHOPPING PLAZA THAT LIES ACROSS I-35. THE ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF TRASH HAS DRAWN THE ATTENTION OF ST. AUGUSTINE HIGH SCHOOL, WHICH HAS PARTNERED WITH RGISC TO UNDERTAKE A LONG-TERM MANADAS CREEK & WETLAND RESTORATION PROJECT OVER THE COURSE OF TWO YEARS. THE PROJECT ENTAILS SEVERAL DAY-LONG CLEANUPS EACH MONTH, AS WELL AS BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY FIELD WORK, TOO. WE ALSO INVITE THE PUBLIC TO JOIN US THE 3RD SATURDAY OF EACH MONTH TO HELP RESTORE THIS SEVERELY DAMAGED AREA.##DESCRIPTION OF OTHER EXEMPT PURPOSE ACCOMPLISHMENT GENERAL: RIVER MONITORING: MEASURE AND DOCUMENT WATER FLOW AND THE LEVEL OF OF POLLUTANTS AND PATHOGENS IN THE RIO GRANDE. FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS, RGISC HAS CONDUCTED MONTHLY SAMPLING OF WATER AT MULTIPLE POINTS ALONG THE RIVER AND SUBMITTING THE DATA TO FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES. NUEVO LAREDO WATER TESTING RGISC HAS WORKED CONSISTENTLY OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES WITH OFFICIALS FROM OUR SISTER CITY IN MEXICO, NUEVO LAREDO, TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF RAW SEWER THAT IS DISCHARGED EACH DAY INTO THE RIVER. AT PRESENT, RELEASES NEARLY 6 MILLION GALLONS OF UNTREATED WASTEWATER INTO THE RIVER EACH DAY, CREATING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGH LEVELS OF E. COLI AND COLIFORM BACTERIA. MOST OF THIS COMES FROM SEWER LINES THAT ARE EITHER ILLEGALLY HOOKED UP TO STORM DRAINS OR ILLEGALLY CHANNELED INTO CREEKS SUCH AS LA JOYA AND LAS ALAZANAS. IN SEPTEMBER 2015, RGISC CONDUCTED WATER TESTING AT SIX SITES ALONG NUEVO LAREDO'S LONG, MEANDERING CREEK SYSTEM KNOWN AS COYOTE. RESULTS SHOWED VERY LOW OXYGEN LEVELS DUE TO HIGH NUTRIENTS AND SOLIDS FROM SOLID WASTE AND POSSIBLY HEAVY METALS. FURTHER TESTING IS NEEDED. IN LATE JANUARY 2015, RGISC ALSO INVESTIGATED THE SOURCE OF THE 3 MILLION GALLONS OF DAILY UNTREATED WASTEWATER EMPTYING INTO THE RIVER FROM NUEVO LAREDO'S ARROYO LA JOYA. FRACKING INSIDE CITY LIMITS IN THE SPRING OF 2015, A NEW TYPE OF URBAN PHENOMENON ENTERED CITY LIMITS - HORIZONTAL DRILLING AND HYDRAULIC FRACTURING. RGISC WORKED CLOSELY WITH RESIDENTS OF GREEN RANCH NEIGHBORHOOD, WHO WERE FACED WITH TWO PERMIT APPLICATIONS FROM AN OPERATOR TO DRILL AND FRACK 2,000 FEET FROM THEIR HOMES. RGISC HELPED RESIDENTS BECOME BETTER INFORMED ABOUT THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE (AT THE LOCAL AND STATE LEVEL) REGARDING FRACKING INSIDE NEIGHBORHOODS, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS OF FRACKING SO CLOSE TO THEIR HOMES. RESIDENTS WITH THE HELP OF RGISC STAFF AND BOARD MEMBERS WORKED WITH LAREDO PLANNERS AND CITY COUNCIL DURING THIS PROCESS. THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVED THE PERMITS BUT ATTACHED 30 CONDITIONS THAT THE OPERATOR MUST COMPLY WITH. THE COUNCIL ALSO VOTED TO UPDATE THE CITY'S OUTDATED DRILLING ORDINANCE AND WORK WITH OTHER GROUPS IN TEXAS TO AMEND HB 40. PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW, RGISC PARTNERED WITH THE NATIONALLY RENOWNED EDF TO HOST A SERIES OF PUBLIC WORKSHOPS IN COUNTIES WITHIN THE EAGLE FORD SHALE. THESE COUNTIES ARE FACING SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY WITH HORIZONTAL DRILLING AND HYDRAULIC FRACTURING (FRACKING) AND ARE THUS ESPECIALLY PRONE TO HAZARDS AFFECTING THEIR AIR, WATER, LAND, AND PUBLIC SAFETY. THE 2015 SERIES OF ""NEIGHBORS OF OIL & GAS"" PRESENTATIONS WERE DELIVERED IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH IN THE CITIES AND TOWNS OF CUERO, KARNES CITY, COTULLA, LAREDO, PLEASANTON, CARRIZO SPRINGS AND COLLEGE STATION. PLASTIC BAG REDUCTION CAMPAIGN IN APRIL 30, 2015, THE LAREDO PLASTIC BAG REDUCTION ORDINANCE TOOK EFFECT, WITH A GOAL OF REDUCING THE NEARLY 120 MILLION PLASTIC BAGS CONSUMED EACH YEAR IN LAREDO. RGISC WORKED WITH HUNDREDS OF VOLUNTEERS, BUSINESS OWNERS, RELIGIOUS AND CIVIC LEADERS, EDUCATORS AND CITY STAFF OVER A 10-YEAR PERIOD TO GET THIS ORDINANCE PASSED. IN 2015, IT CONTINUED ITS EDUCATION AWARENESS CAMPAIGN BY DISTRIBUTING THOUSANDS OF LOVING LAREDO REUSABLE BAGS AT MULTIPLE EVENTS, AND HOLDING TALKS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH MULTIPLE GROUPS AND AT MULTIPLE SCHOOLS, AS WELL AS MONITORING LEGAL HEARINGS IN A LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST THE CITY BY A SMALL GROUP OF MERCHANTS. THE MERCHANTS LOST THE LAWSUIT, AND HAVE APPEALED THAT RULING TO A HIGHER COURT. NATURE EDUCATION: IN 2015, RGISC ORGANIZED VARIOUS CLEANUPS THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY, PARTICULARLY ALONG CREEK SYSTEMS AND OTHER WATERWAYS: 1.LAS PALMAS NATURE TRAIL ON JAN. 17 AS PART OF MLK SERVICE DAY, 2.A TWO-DAY BLITZ AT LAKE CASA BLANCA TO REMOVE 5 TONS OF TRASH LEFT BEHIND BY THOUSANDS OF VISITORS OVER THE EASTER WEEKEND, AND 3.A SMALLER CLEANUP AT HILLSIDE PARK WITH MEMBERS OF A LOCAL CUB SCOUTS. RGISC ALSO PROVIDES NUMEROUS TALKS AND PRESENTATIONS, YEAR-ROUND, TO DIFFERENT GROUPS AND SCHOOLS ABOUT CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS, AND TO ALSO INFORM THEM ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF NATURAL AREAS IN OUR MIDST. ECOAMBASSADORS LAUNCHED IN 2013, OUR ECO AMBASSADOR YOUTH OUTREACH PROGRAM IS GEARED FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, AND SOME COLLEGE STUDENTS. WE TRAIN STUDENTS ABOUT THE RIVER AND PRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AFFECTING LAREDO. LAS PALMAS NATURE TRAIL IN 2015, WE WERE ABLE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH CITY OF LAREDO OFFICIALS TO CIRCUMVENT AND NOT CUT THROUGH THE ONE-OF-A-KIND LAS PALMAS NATURE TRAIL FOR A ROAD TO SERVICE THE UPCOMING DOWNTOWN OUTLET MALL. WE ALSO HELD MULTIPLE MEETINGS WITH BORDER PATROL TO ACHIEVE AN AGREEMENT TO MINIMIZE THEIR USE OF ALL TERRAIN VEHICLES (ATVS) AND ELIMINATE HEAVY SUVS INSIDE LAS PALMAS NATURE TRAIL - ALL OF WHICH WERE DESTROYING AND HEAVILY ERODING THE FRAGILE RIVER SILT TRAIL.

THE GOAL IS TO HIGHLIGHT THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF ECO-TOURISM, AND TO DEMONSTRATE THE NEED FOR LOCAL LEADERS TO PRESERVE REGIONAL GREEN SPACES. THE FESTIVAL RESULTED IN MORE THAN 110 REGISTERED BIRDERS FROM OTHER CITIES IN TEXAS, THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO. THEY WENT ON DAILY FIELD TRIPS AND ATTENDED MULTIPLE TALKS BY BIRDING EXPERTS. RGISC OVERSAW ALL DETAILS OF THE FESTIVAL AND WORKED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LOCAL MONTE MUCHO AUDUBON SOCIETY AND CITY'S CONVENTION & VISITOR'S BUREAU. THE FESTIVAL ALSO INCLUDED VARIOUS COMMUNITY OUTREACH EVENTS FOR LOCALS: -A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL BIRD ART CONTEST THAT WAS OPEN TO THE COMMUNITY, AND RECEIVED NEARLY 300 QUALITY ART SUBMISSIONS. -AN ENGAGING COMMUNITY TALK AT THE PUBLIC LIBRARY WITH A BIRDER WHO BIKED ACROSS THE COUNTRY RAISING FUNDS FOR HABITAT PRESERVATION, AND -A FUN WITH FEATHERY FRIENDS CHILDREN'S EVENT AT THE LAREDO PUBLIC LIBRARY, FOR NEARLY 100 YOUTH TO LEARN ABOUT LOCAL BIRDS AND HOW TO USE BIRDING OPTICS.##DESCRIPTION OF 3RD EXEMPT PURPOSE ACCOMPLISHMENT GREEN SPACES PRESERVATION: TO INCREASE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR LAREDO/WEBB COUNTY RESIDENTS THROUGH PRESERVATION OF OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. IN THE 1990S, RGISC PROPOSED THE IDEA AND SECURED NECESSARY SEED MONEY TO BEGIN CONSTRUCTION OF THE LAMAR BRUNI VERGARA ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE CENTER, WHICH IS NOW PART OF LAREDO COMMUNITY COLLEGE. RGISC ACTIVELY ASSISTED IN WRITING THE CITY OF LAREDO'S TWO MOST SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL ORDINANCES: HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND GREEN SPACE PRESERVATION. RGISC ALSO HELPED INITIATE THE DIALOGUE TO ESTABLISH THE CITY'S ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT. RGISC OPPOSED BUILDING A BORDER WALL WITHIN THE RIVER VEGA. IT HAS ADVOCATED VIGOROUSLY AGAINST AERIAL SPRAYING OF THE HERBICIDE IMAZAPYR BY THE U.S. BORDER PATROL ON OR NEAR THE RIVER, WHERE IT REPRESENTS A HAZARD TO HUMANS AND RIVER WILDLIFE. RGISC ALSO BROUGHT ATTENTION TO THE NEAR DESTRUCTION OF A CRITICAL INNER CITY WETLAND AT LAKE CASA BLANCA BY ACQUIRING 13,000 SIGNATURES AND HOLDING COUNTLESS MEETING WITH CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS, AND THE U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS. IN JANUARY 2013, THE CITY COUNCIL EVENTUALLY VOTED TO SELL ALL OF THIS LAND FOR DEVELOPMENT WITH VERY LITTLE BEING PRESERVED AS A WETLAND FEATURE. MANADAS CREEK & WETLAND RESTORATION PROJECT ON A BRANCH OF MANADAS CREEK, NEAR THE INTERSECTION OF I-35 AND MINES ROAD, LIES ONE OF LAREDO'S LAST REMAINING WETLANDS. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS ISOLATED AND FRAGILE ECO-SYSTEM HAS BECOME THE RESTING PLACE FOR TONS OF TRASH FROM RAIN EVENTS, AND HUNDREDS OF SHOPPING CARTS FROM THE NORTH CREEK SHOPPING PLAZA THAT LIES ACROSS I-35. THE ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF TRASH HAS DRAWN THE ATTENTION OF ST. AUGUSTINE HIGH SCHOOL, WHICH HAS PARTNERED WITH RGISC TO UNDERTAKE A LONG-TERM MANADAS CREEK & WETLAND RESTORATION PROJECT OVER THE COURSE OF TWO YEARS. THE PROJECT ENTAILS SEVERAL DAY-LONG CLEANUPS EACH MONTH, AS WELL AS BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY FIELD WORK, TOO. WE ALSO INVITE THE PUBLIC TO JOIN US THE 3RD SATURDAY OF EACH MONTH TO HELP RESTORE THIS SEVERELY DAMAGED AREA.","THE RGISC MISSION IS TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT THE RIO GRANDE-RIO BRAVO, ITS WATERSHED AND ENVIRONMENT, THROUGH AWARENESS, ADVOCACY, RESEARCH, EDUCATION, STEWARDSHIP AND BI-NATIONAL COLLABORATION FOR THE BENEFIT OF PRESENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS.",2.016322193493011e+17,14009213.0,990,12/16/2016 8:06:24 PM,RGISC INC,201512.0,2016.0,2015.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our education and outreach programs occur in a wide variety of formats and reach diverse audiences. During the tax year, TALT's outreach efforts included: workshops in Alpine, Uvalde and Corpus Christi for landowners and their advisors; MCLE presentations given to landowners and attorneys in Amarillo and San Antonio; TALT hosted a one day follow up meeting with the attendees from the Conservation Finance Network Summit focusing on developing funding sources for conservation easements; multiple speaking engagements with strategic partner organizations such as Society for Rangeland Management, Texas Parks and Wildlife, Texas Masternaturalist, Texas Wildlife Association and Texas State University. TALT also initiated the No Land No Water campaign to successfully garner funding support for the Texas Farms and Ranch Land Conservation Program through legislative action. In addition, TALTs work at the federal level helped to make permanent the deduction for the donated conservation easement. Through the use of its newsletter, social media and speaking engagements, TALT educates an urban audience regarding the public benefits of rural working lands.##Conservation easements to protect working lands: TALT partners with landowners who seek donated conservation easements, purchase of development rights, and mitigation banks. TALT staff provides professional, efficient, responsive and experienced service for the negotiations of conservation easements. TALT's processes have been developed over the past nine years and incorporate best management practices from the Land Trust Alliance (LTA) and from members of the partnership of rangeland trusts. At the end of the tax year, TALT held conservation easements on nearly 225,000 acres of Texas farms and ranches throughout the state. TALT today is the largest state-based land trust in Texas and numbers among in the top 15 regional or state wide land trusts in the country according to a recent LTA census.","The mission of the Texas Agricultural Land Trust (TALT) is to conserve the Texas heritage of agricultural lands, natural resources and wildlife habitats. TALT works to sustain the long-term stewardship of private lands for the benefit of all Texans. TALT accomplishes its mission through the use of voluntary conservation measures and through education and outreach efforts. TALT partners with private landowners to negotiate and transact conservation easements that protect important conservation values, in accordance with IRC Section 170(h). These privately stewarded lands provide public benefits such as productive agricultural lands, scenic views, drinking water protection, natural wildlife habitat and open space. Additionally, with a state that holds 94% privately owned lands, TALT works to educate the public on the many public benefits provided by the stewardship of private lands, and to educate Texas landowners about the use of conservation easements.

93493237006136.0,760183954,EFILE,,,,,"OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 4: Buffalo Bend Nature Park - Consists of a series of graded, water-treatment wetlands. Once completed, this environmental park will contribute to the restoration and enhancement of Buffalo Bayou and the downstream coastal ecosystems it impacts. Buffalo Bend will provide East End residents a direct link to the heritage of the city and a higher quality of life that offers hiking, bird watching, environmental education and most importantly, a sense of wilderness that many locals from this community rarely have the opportunity to experience. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 5: Conservation - Buffalo Bayou Partnerships Conservation Program encompasses multiple park spaces and other wild areas along the bayou. Conservation efforts take place at Shepherd Drive and extend as far as the Port of Houston turning basin in the East End. Activities include understory and tree planting in the fall and winter and invasive plant removal in the spring and summer. Other activities include watering (as necessary), trash clean-up/removal, and herbicide treatment to invasive trees, such as Chinese Tallow and China Berry. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 6: Land Acquisition - BBP has an ongoing land acquisition program for trails and facilities along both sides of Buffalo Bayou from Shepherd Drive to Lockwood Drive. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 7: Sunset Coffee Building (formerly known as the International Coffee Building) - Built in 1910, the facility is being transformed into Buffalo Bayou's premier recreational and cultural center. The building will include an outdoor plaza, biking and boating rental facility, historical exhibits, and a rooftop terrace. An earnest money contract for sale of the building to a local government entity of the City upon completion of its renovation was executed in May, 2012. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 8: A top priority of Buffalo Bayou Partnership is to build a continuous system of trails on the north and south banks of Buffalo Bayou from Shepherd Drive to the Turning Basin. This will give Houstonians and visitors 20 miles of trails to run, walk and bike along our waterway. To accommodate residents and visitors who want to enjoy a walk or jog along the Shepherd Drive to Sabine Street stretch of the bayou, BBP added asphalt footpaths closer to the waterway. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 9: Clean & Green Program - A project with the Port of Houston and Shell Oil that utilizes community service workers to clean the bayou of trash and debris. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 10: Buffalo Bayou Partnership's Bayou Buddies is a membership and events group made up of young professionals dedicated to BBP's mission to transform and revitalize Buffalo Bayou, Houston's greatest natural resource. Bayou Bash is Bayou Buddies' annual fundraiser featuring live music, crawfish, pontoon boat rides, lawn games, and silent auction. Proceeds support Buffalo Bayou Partnership activities.","Buffalo Bayou Partnership (""BBP"") is transforming and revitalizing Buffalo Bayou, Houstons most significant natural resource. BBPs geographic focus is the 10-square mile stretch of Buffalo Bayou from Shepherd Drive to the Port of Houston Turning Basin.","Buffalo Bayou Park (formerly known as Shepherd to Sabine) - A strong public-private partnership including the Kinder Foundation, Buffalo Bayou Partnership (""BBP""), the City of Houston, and Harris County Flood Control District carried out an ambitious $58 million restoration project for the bayou's Shepherd to Sabine stretch. The project involved flood management, eco-restoration, new hike and bike trails, and an array of park amenities. The park improvements were substantially completed for the Shepherd to Sabine project in 2015, and BBP transferred ownership to the City. A grand opening ceremony for the park was held in October of 2015.##Skimmer Boat program - Removing trash and debris is central to BBP's mission of helping to restore Buffalo Bayou to an ecologically functional system. The program, funded by the Harris County Flood Control District, removes floatables from the water and along the banks of the bayou.##A top priority of Buffalo Bayou Partnership is to build a continuous system of trails on the north and south banks of Buffalo Bayou from Shepherd Drive to the Turning Basin.

Today, in every area, our sustainable story dominates civic discussion. We have slowly changed the direction of the City and region, and will continue to capitalize on these gains to realize a vision we know from surveys is shared by the people of Houston. Houston Tomorrow promotes sustainable development of our regions built environment. How we build infrastructure and other facilities impacts whether our citizens have access to quality food and water; to streets that are safe for all users; to greenspaces and parks; to walkable neighborhoods, to a healthier lifestyle, and to a choice of transportation types that includes walking, biking, driving, and transit. (Continued below.)##Houston Tomorrow works to align public spending and policies with citizen priorities to distribute scarce infrastructure money in a balanced way among transit, road repair, bike and pedestrian facilities, and new roads. We address issues of equity and work to bring meaningful equity to regional decision making on transportation funding and planning for the future of all our communities. Houston Tomorrow recognizes that the built environment in our 134 towns and cities is an investment that needs to be maintained and improved, and advocates for sustainable development in many neighborhoods in these existing places, rather than in natural and agricultural lands at the edges of the region. (continued below)##Houston Tomorrow is recognized as a trusted, independent information source that provides research, analysis, and best practices to keep citizens, policymakers, and business leaders informed about sustainable development. We do this broadly through our website, newsletter, ongoing public events, incisive presentations, input to the policy making process, and white papers and publications. Houston Tomorrow tackles big issues that other organizations are unwilling or unable to address, and thus stands alone in Houston as the primary proponent of broad principles for sustainable development that improves the environment, community,and economy.","Our mission is to improve the quality of life for all the people of the Houston region.

In 2015, GBFs Water Monitoring Team was represented (at year-end) by 32 volunteers who sampled from 37 sites, including 16 who sampled for Enterococcus bacteria from 21 sites. GBF also contributed to the development of an easy-to-use Citizen Science Data Portal for the entire Gulf of Mexico in partnership with the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Ocean Observing System (GCOOS). We began the planning stages for the new Galveston Bay Dolphin Research and Conservation Program in partnership with the Environmental Institute of Houston. GBF continued to be actively engaged in discussion and planning on improving coastal resiliency and to advocate for the allocation of research dollars to the region to ensure the health of Galveston Bay and its users.",The Galveston Bay Foundation works to ensure a clean and healthy Galveston Bay that can be enjoyed by people today and for generations to come. Our diverse programs preserve and protect Texas largest and most productive estuary.,"GBFs conservation programs focus on estuarine habitat preservation, protection, and restoration. Continuing our work as a nationally accredited land trust, GBF acquired conservation easements on two properties1) a 675-acre tract that is part of Harris County Flood Control Districts mitigation bank near Greens Bayou in northeast Houston that serves to offset wetland impacts associated with future flood control efforts in Harris County and 2) a 1,700-acre tract consisting of high quality coastal wetland and prairie habitat known as Gordy Marsh near Smith Point in Chambers County. In our role as a facilitator for conservation work across the Gulf states, GBF obligated funds from the Knobloch Family Foundation to members of the Partnership for Gulf Coast Land Conservation to help pay for due diligence costs associated with 20 land acquisition projects targeting Deepwater Horizon settlement funds for the proposed conservation of more than 28,000 acres across all five Gulf States. We also worked extensively to restore degraded habitats around Galveston Bay. In 2015, we removed 19 abandoned and derelict vessels from locations all around the Bay; created, restored, and enhanced approximately 50 acres of freshwater wetlands and adjacent prairie habitat at our Rich Sanctuary property as part of the Wetland Reserve Program; created a 30-acre freshwater wetland for waterfowl and enhanced over 150 acres of existing man-made wetlands on the Austin Bayou Woods property to provide habitat for waterfowl, wading birds, and other wetland dependent species; worked with three private landowners and a county park to create living shorelines on their waterfronts; and put to use our first funds stemming from the BP oil spill via NFWFs Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund on the Oyster Lake and Moses Lake/Dollar Bay projects. Our oyster programs ranged from oyster shell recycling to oyster gardening, to nearshore reef restoration. We welcomed a new restaurantCaptain Bennys Seafoodinto the oyster shell recycling program and continued collecting oyster shell from Tommys Oyster Bar, Topwater Grill, the Kemah Boardwalk, and Crazy Alans Swamp Shack, reclaiming an estimated 156 tons of shell during 2015, an 18% increase in shells collected from 2014. We gardened oysters with the assistance of over 30 volunteers who deployed 0.71 cubic yards of recycled oyster shell, 10% of which contained spat, on existing reefs in Kemah and San Leon. We also created over 230 feet of oyster bar breakwaters along Sweetwater Lake, utilizing approximately 44 tons of oyster shell from the recycling program and assistance from 360 volunteers during 12 volunteer workdays. We also hosted numerous community-based habitat enhancement events including TPWDs annual Abandoned Crab Trap Removal event at the Fort Anahuac Park site, in which we removed 147 crab traps from Trinity Bay with the assistance of 50 volunteers and 6 boats; a River, Lakes, Bays,N Bayous Trash Bash event at Bay Area Park, in which 803 volunteers collected an estimated 3.4 tons of trash, recyclables, and compostable materials as well as 53 tires from the Armand Bayou watershed; and Marsh Mania marsh grass planning events in the spring and fall, in which 255 volunteers planted 1.3 acres of estuarine intertidal marsh. We also coordinated a trash cleanup along a half-mile section of shoreline at Morgans Point with the Port of Houston Authority, Audubon Texas, and approximately 40 community volunteers in response to public concern for the littered beach, and planted 133 trees at locations including Exploration Green in Harris County, Sweetwater Nature Preserve in Galveston County, and Turtle Bayou Nature Preserve in Chambers County.##GBFs education programs allowed us to reach thousands of youth and adults in 2015, with events and campaigns aimed at increasing the publics awareness of the importance of Galveston Bay as well as more structured programs that provide science-based environmental education focused on Galveston Bay. We hosted the ninth annual Bike Around the Bay sponsored by Shell, which allowed us to bring our message to more than 1,150 registered cyclists and over 300 volunteers and expose them to the beauty of the Bay. We also hosted the Bay Day Festival at the Kemah Boardwalk, with 30 educational exhibits, support from 50 volunteers, and an estimated attendance of over 5,000 visitors. We concluded the 2014-15 Get Hip to Habitat year by serving 1,949 students at 22 schools and kicked off the 2015-16 school year with participation by 19 schools. We delivered Bay Ambassador presentations to 2,746 students and professional development training workshops and resources to 24 educators. We launched the Cease the Grease campaign with over 15 participating partners, including four campaign videos, a new website featuring a cooking oil recycling map and proper disposal methods for fats, oils, and grease, and educational handouts and games, which altogether made over 389,000 impressions.##GBFs advocacy program attempts to balance the multiple uses of Galveston Bay so that the long-term interests of the Bay itself are not compromised. In 2015, in partnership with the Houston Advanced Research Center, GBF released the inaugural Galveston Bay Report Card, with the Bay earning an overall grade of C, and began spreading the message on how the Galveston Bay community can work to improve this grade. We created and debuted the Galveston Bay Action Network pollution reporting tool that allows the public to report incidences of pollution around the Bay and automatically forwards those reports to one of nine authorities in charge of response/enforcement. In its first year, we received 39 pollution reports and reached 47,296 people on social media. We offered nine Rain Barrel Workshops with a total audience of 358 people who received 423 rain barrels and kits, potentially reducing 468,750 gallons of stormwater runoff from reaching Galveston Bay and improving water conservation in seven different cities within our watershed. Our volunteer Wetland Permit Review Committeeactive for a consecutive 26 yearsreviewed 42 applications for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permits and provided letters of concern or comments on 17 of them. GBF also completed the first draft of the application to designate Galveston Bay as a No Discharge Zone.","The mission of the Galveston Bay Foundation is to preserve, protect, and enhance the natural resources of the Galveston Bay estuarine system and its tributaries for present users and for posterity.",2.016332093493067e+17,14263984.0,990,4/7/2017 4:17:10 PM,GALVESTON BAY FOUNDATION INC,201512.0,2017.0,2015.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conservancy staff maintain and clean the Parks grounds including water areas and hardscapes. Conservancy gardeners plant and water trees and weed flower beds. All maintenance of the 15-acre McGovern Centennial Gardens and landscaped parking lot is done by Conservancy staff. Nine full-time employees manage and maintain the gardens. The McGovern Centennial Gardens rental venues, the Cherie Flores Garden Pavilion and the Celebration Garden are staffed by a full-time manager and two part-time event coordinators as well as several maintenance staff. In addition, thousands of hours are contributed by dedicated Conservancy volunteers in the McGovern Centennial Gardens, the Japanese Garden, and throughout the Park. Volunteers are involved in Park maintenance, horticulture and reforestation in the Japanese Garden and assisting with annual Park events.##Planning, Design and Construction The Conservancy identified underdeveloped areas of the Park that could be developed into more visitor-friendly landscapes and brought prominent landscape architecture firm, Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, onboard to study the Parks needs and develop an updated master plan to guide improvements for the next 20 years. The Grand Gateway renovation was completed in 2016. In addition to funds raised by the Centennial Campaign, the $5 million projects funding included nearly $3 million from a grant awarded through the Texas Department of Transportation, which managed the project with the Conservancy and the City of Houston. The project improved connectivity to nearby neighborhoods, added irrigation for the live oaks lining Main Street, and updated the Parks historic main entrance with colorful seasonal plantings. The Conservancy and the City of Houston collaborated on a restoration project in the Japanese Garden ahead of the gardens 25th anniversary in 2017. The restoration project included structural improvements as well as a new dry-stream garden. Architecture firm Curtis & Windham moved forward with the next phase of restoration of Hermann Parks historic clubhouse, built in 1933. By the end of fiscal year, the Conservancy had secured nearly $3.3 million toward its $5.8 million goal.##Visitor ServicesThe Visitor Services department was developed in 2008 when Hermann Park Conservancy was awarded the contract by the City of Houston to manage the Hermann Park Railroad. Visitor Services oversees and operates the train, pedal boats, and Pinewood Cafe and coordinates activities with the Conservancy Gift Shop and food vendors throughout the Park. The department hosts special programs at Lake Plaza including a yearly birthday party for Park namesake, George Hermann, the holiday train, a festive holiday party with arts and crafts and other activities, holiday brunches at Pinewood Cafe, and student performances. Approximately 40 staff members are responsible for creating an exciting and memorable experience for Park visitors and keeping Lake Plaza operating efficiently and safely.

As part of ASE's general outreach efforts, our astronaut and cosmonaut members visit schools, universities and youth groups world-wide and interact with thousands of teachers, parents and students each year. ASE continuously explores creative ways to engage and inspire the next generation of scientists, astronauts and engineers.In 2016, ASE-USA continued its partnership with Ardusat, Inc. and Northrop Grumman Corporation to provide exciting and unique opportunities for high-school aged teams to conduct their own real research experiment in Earth orbit on board a real satellite. Participants engage with focused online course content, and will design and build their own programs to monitor any of the 20 sensors onboard, using a variety of real-time, online resources. This unique program is intended to drive students toward STEM education and careers and to give them hands on, project-based learning experience in multiple formats - in the classroom, through independent study, or via science clubs and other after-school activities. ASE-USA spent $13,500 to support thirty-four teams from across the USA, who were selected to prepare and fly space experiments. Many of the teams tested their experiments on a balloon launch that went to 100,000 feet and several have completed their space experiments.ASE-USA also awarded scholarships at George Mason University and at Washington State University.At each Planetary Congress, ASE members dedicate a full day for outreach with the local and national communities in the country where the Congress is being hosted. The astronauts and cosmonauts reach thousands of students, teachers, parents, and members of the general public to inspire and promote education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. ASE-USA member astronauts also engage with students and teachers throughout the year in the USA with school and university visits and lectures, as well as via partnerships with other educational organizations.##Planetary Congress of ASE and International Space Exploration communication and support: Since 1985, ASE has convened an annual Planetary Congress to serve as a forum where members interact professionally and develop ASE programs. Members exchange information about their national space programs, make technical presentations on selected topics relevant to human space flight operations.Ninety-two astronauts and cosmonauts from nineteen nations convened September 20-27, 2015 for the XXVIII Planetary Congress. Delegates participated in workshops and in educational outreach to local schools and the general public. ASE also participated and sponsored regional meetings, summits and reunions all over the world. These meetings and conferences provide members the opportunity to share information and promote the mission of ASE##Earth Stewardship. ASE provides members opportunities to communicate their unique perspective of Earth to help stimulate humanity's sense of responsibility for the future of our planet. ASE considers it important to provide its members with opportunities to communicate their unique perspective of Earth to help stimulate humanity's sense of responsibility for the future of our planet. Among ASE's premier activities in the area of environmental education have been the publication of the international best-seller The Home Planet in hard and soft cover, partnership in the development and deployment of the on-orbit astronaut earth photography tool Windows on Earth, participation in the United Nations Earth Day and Mission to Planet Earth ceremonies and sponsorship of environmental films and videos.","The Association of Space Explorers (ASE) serves as a professional forum for its members to promote the exchange of space flight experiences and technical information concerning space operations, science, development, testing and training. In particular, the ASE Planetary Congress affords a unique opportunity for communication between members of the international space community, government agencies and the public.ASE's vision is a world where living, working, and exploring in space will be as familiar to humanity as life on our home planet. ASE's mission is to apply the unique perspective of its members to promote the global benefits of space science, exploration and international cooperation; to educate and inspire future generations, and; to foster better stewardship of our home planet.",,,,,,,2.0172045934920083e+17,14606040.0,990EZ,8/2/2017 10:11:39 PM,ASSOCIATION OF SPACE EXPLORERS USA,201606.0,2017.0,2016.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WE ARE AWAITING A DATE FOR THAT HEARING, AND ARE WORKING WITH ATTORNEYS FROM AUSTIN WHO WILL FILE AN AMICUS BRIEF ON OUR BEHALF WITH THE TEXAS SUPREME COURT. PROPOSED INDUSTRIAL WASTE LANDFILL IN JULY 2016, WE SUBMITTED WRITTEN COMMENTS AND RAISED CONCERNS WITH THE TEXAS COMMISSION ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ABOUT THE PROPOSED CLASS I LANDFILL. IT WOULD BE ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE STATE AND BRING IN 1-3.65 MILLION TONS OF WASTE - INDUSTRIAL SOLID AND LIQUID WASTE, AND MUNICIPAL WASTE - PER YEAR. WE ALSO ATTENDED AND SPOKE AT A STATE HEARING HELD IN THE SUMMER WITH OUR CONCERNS FOCUSED ON THE FLOODPLAIN, POTENTIAL AIR IMPACTS FOR NEARBY COLONIA RESIDENTS, AND THE TYPES OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE THAT IS PLANNED FOR THE SITE, SUCH AS COAL ASH.

WE, INSTEAD, SUPPORT THE SCIENTIFICALLY SUCCESSFUL USDA METHODS TO REDUCE THE WATER-INTENSIVE CANE WITH BIOLOGICAL AGENTS AND MECHANICAL TOPPING METHODS. WE VIGOROUSLY OPPOSE AERIAL SPRAYING OF THE HERBICIDE IMAZAPYR AND OTHER CHEMICALS ON OR NEAR THE RIVER, WHERE IT REPRESENTS A HAZARD TO HUMANS AND RIVER WILDLIFE. PROPOSED OIL REFINERY IN NOVEMBER 2016, WE LEARNED OF PLANS TO CONSTRUCT THE FIRST OIL REFINERY IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE THE 1970S LESS THAN 5 MILES UPWIND FROM THE SMALL AND RURAL WEBB COUNTY COMMUNITY OF BRUNI. THIS IS LOCATED ABOUT 45 MILES TO THE SOUTHEAST OF LAREDO. PLANS CALL FOR PROCESSING 50,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE PER DAY AND SHIPPING IT VIA RAIL, THRU LAREDO INTO MEXICO. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS (AIR AND WATER) AND SIGNIFICANT HEALTH RISKS FOR BRUNI RESIDENTS AND STUDENTS WHO ATTEND THE MS/HS CAMPUS THAT SERVES THAT ENTIRE REGION. WE HELD A MEETING WITH THE COUNTY JUDGE TO GATHER MORE INFORMATION, AND BEGAN TO CONSULT WITH SCIENTISTS WHO WORK WITH COMMUNITIES LIVING NEXT TO REFINERIES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS. WE JOINED FORCES WITH SURROUNDING LANDOWNERS AND RANCHES, AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS AND FORMED THE SOUTH TEXANS AGAINST THE REFINERY (STAR) COALITION.

THIS IS PART OF A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN LED BY THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE FEDERATION TO HELP RESTORE THE PLUMMETING POPULATION OF THE MONARCH BUTTERFLY SPECIES, WHICH HAS DECLINED BY 80-90 PERCENT OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES. AS PART OF THIS CAMPAIGN, WE WILL HELP LAREDO FULFILL CERTAIN ACTION ITEMS TO HELP CREATE SUITABLE POLLINATOR HABITAT AND EDUCATE CITIZENS ABOUT WHERE AND HOW TO GROW MILKWEED - A CRITICAL FOOD SOURCE FOR THE MONARCH. THIS INCLUDES BUILDING BUTTERFLY WAY STATIONS AT OUR LOCAL STATE PARK, LAKE CASA BLANCA. FUNDRAISERS GOLF TOURNAMENT IN NOVEMBER 2016, RGISC HELD ITS 7TH ANNUAL ""BIRDIES ON THE RIO"" GOLF TOURNAMENT, ITS LARGEST FUNDRAISER OF THE YEAR.

Each year, CEE's benchmark programs provide materials and training for more than 35,000 educators, who reach millions of young people with essential information about conservation and the environment. See below for a description of each of CEE's educational programs.Project WILD is a supplementary, interdisciplinary, instructional program for educators of students in kindergarten through high school that is balanced and fair, neither pro nor con on value-sensitive issues. Project WILD's mission is to provide wildlife-based conservation and environmental education that fosters responsible actions toward wildlife and related natural resources. The goal of Project WILD is to assist learners of any age in developing awareness, knowledge, skills and commitment to result in informed decisions, responsible behavior and constructive actions concerning wildlife and the environment upon which all life depends.The Flying WILD program engages middle schools in bird education efforts with the intent of encouraging increased environmental stewardship among youth. Special emphasis is placed on creating an approach that is readily adaptable for urban schools, often with underserved students who traditionally receive few opportunities to participate in environmental education initiatives.Growing Up WILD is an early childhood education program that builds on childrens sense of wonder about nature and invites them to explore wildlife and the world around them. Through a wide range of activities and experiences, Growing Up WILD provides an early foundation for developing positive impressions about the natural world and lifelong social and academic skills.WET in the City engages K-12 youth in hands-on activities that creatively explore the science of water, its cultural context, and complex issues surrounding its management and stewardship.

Currently, over 900 acres are actively managed within our preserve boundaries. Critical prairie habitat is annually being restored and then preserved through controlled burns and mowing to reduce invasive species and replanting native grasses and forbs propagated in our native plant nursery. More recently, ABNC has assumed management of a 24-acre tract that specifically protects the endangered Prairie Dawn Flower species. Additionally, ABNC manages over 330 acres of Texas State Coastal Preserve in the Armand Bayou watershed, restoring intertidal marsh to maintain appropriate water depth and encourage native plant and animal recolonization.##Education: Over 9,500 students of all ages participate in ABNC environmental education programs annually. School groups attend Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) correlated outdoor classes, field trips, and unique natural and cultural history programs. ABNC offers outdoor nature camps each summer and winter, scouting and similar youth programs, and community outreaches. ABNC has also introduced a range of early-childhood outdoor programs and STEM focused classes to support home school programs.##Visitor Services: Over 20,000 guests visit ABNC annually, another 2,000 member visits are also recorded. Almost 2,500 people travel to ABNC to attend meetings and private events each year. Visitors follow the self-guided accessible Discovery Trail interpretive loop to habitat overlooks, interpretive exhibits and historical farm displays; others venture out on over 5 miles of developed hiking trails. Volunteers help ABNC conduct numerous interpretive activities, including guided trail hikes, animal demonstrations, hands-on-history craft demonstrations, and guided canoe and pontoon boat tours of Armand Bayou. ABNC special places are also available for family retreats, company meetings and seasonal parties. Several community groups utilize ABNC meeting spaces, and ABNC regularly hosts nature-related conferences.",To preserve the habitats with which we have been entrusted and to provide opportunities for people to experience and understand the local ecosystems.

The goal of Project WILD is to assist learners of any age in developing awareness, knowledge, skills and commitment to result in informed decisions, responsible behavior and constructive actions concerning wildlife and the environment upon which all life depends.The Flying WILD program engages middle schools in bird education efforts with the intent of encouraging increased environmental stewardship among youth. Special emphasis is placed on creating an approach that is readily adaptable for urban schools, often with underserved students who traditionally receive few opportunities to participate in environmental education initiatives.Growing Up WILD is an early childhood education program that builds on childrens sense of wonder about nature and invites them to explore wildlife and the world around them. Through a wide range of activities and experiences, Growing Up WILD provides an early foundation for developing positive impressions about the natural world and lifelong social and academic skills.WET in the City engages K-12 youth in hands-on activities that creatively explore the science of water, its cultural context, and complex issues surrounding its management and stewardship.

At the end of the tax year, TALT held conservation easements on nearly 226,000 acres of Texas farms and ranches throughout the state. TALT today is the largest state-based land trust in Texas and numbers among in the top 15 regional or state wide land trusts in the country according to a recent LTA census.##Outreach on public benefit of conservation easements of private, working lands: TALT's outreach work falls into two categories: to educate landowners and their advisors on how to use conservation easements to protect, conserve and pass land down to future generations; and to communicate the need to protect agricultural lands and open space, and the many benefits - such as clean and plentiful drinking water, domestic and affordable food and fiber, and wildlife habitat - that these lands provide to all Texans. Our education and outreach programs occur in a wide variety of formats and reach diverse audiences. During the tax year, TALT's outreach efforts included: landowner workshops in Corpus, Brazoria and Victoria; sponsorship and attendance of Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Ranch Gatherings across the state; presentations to the Wildlife Committee of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, Natural Resource Conservation Services State Technical Advisory Committee, TPWD district staff, Texas Chapter of The Wildlife Society, financial planners, CPAs and attorneys in McAllen, and South Texas Property Rights Association; attendance and participation at Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers annual convention, Texas Wildlife Association annual convention, Trans-Pecos Wildlife Conference, Texas Land and Mineral Owners Association, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Institute, Texas Coalition for Conservation and the Fort Worth Livestock Show and Rodeo.

KPC also monitors its conservation easement lands on an annual basis to ensure that the goals and objectives of the legal agreement between KPC and the impacted landowner are followed and the land in question remains viable for its conservation values. KPC is working to establish more vigorous baseline data on all its preserves and to tract changes over time through regular monitoring protocols.Land Management and Restoration - During 2004-2005, KPC's Board of Directors approved securing a majority ownership of the historic Warren Ranch, a working cattle ranch. The Board determined that the continued operations of the Warren Ranch were part of KPC's mission to protect the unique scenic, historic and natural sites on the Katy Prairie. They noted that well-managed farmland shelters wildlife, supplies scenic open space, and helps filter impurities from our air and water and that these agricultural lands offer many other benefits as well: preservation of open space and natural resources; outdoor recreation, including bird watching, hiking, hunting, and nature tours; improved flood protection; economic development through eco-tourism; enhanced wildlife habitat; recharge zones for the area's aquifers; educational field trips for area youth, and research opportunities for colleges and universities in ecology and land management. The prairie also provides children who might not otherwise have an opportunity to visit a working ranch to ride a horse or tour a farm to see how food is produced - a distinctive outdoor experience.","Long-term goals are to: protect 50,000 acres; allow public access; ensure responsible stewardship of protected lands; restore and enhance wildlife habitat; offer educational programs; and conduct and facilitate appropriate research to accomplish KPCs mission.","Land Conservation - The Katy Prairie Conservancy (KPC) protects land on the Katy Prairie in the following ways: acquisition of conservation lands at fair market value, acquisition of conservation lands through a bargain sale arrangement, receipt of donated conservation lands to KPC, receipt of donated trade lands to KPC, donation of conservation easements to KPC, and purchase of development rights on conservation lands on the Katy Prairie. Conservation lands are held in permanent trust and are maintained for the benefit of both the wildlife that inhabit the lands and the public who enjoy visiting KPC's preserves.##Preserve Enhancement - KPC has developed general management plans for all its protected properties that ensure that the lands are not further degraded by invasive species (including Chinese Tallow, McCartney Rose, feral hogs and other feral animals) and are maintained in their traditional uses. More detailed management plans are prepared for properties as KPC undertakes preserve enhancement and restoration activities, including the restoration and creation of wetlands and the enhancement and replanting of native grasslands.##Community Education and Outreach - KPC offered more than 100 events, tours, and programs to enable the public to enjoy different aspects of the Katy Prairie, including its bi-monthly Unplugged Adventures (special activities at KPC's preserves), guided tours, and training for current and prospective volunteers. In addition KPC also hosts small group tours (working in cooperation with other conservation entities and area naturalists) as well as field trips for young people. Interpretive signs and field guides enhance the visitor experience and expanded outreach and marketing efforts through KPC's website and use of electronic newsletter reached broader audiences. KPC also has developed programming at area schools and parks to make people more aware of the importance of prairies to the region.","Katy Prairie Conservancy (KPC) is dedicated to protecting a sustainable portion of the Katy Prairie for the benefit of its wildlife and the enjoyment of all Texans.

The annual planetary Congress allows the members to work towards the organization's mission and vision by providing broad and deep professional technical interchanges among the members and attendees. Valuable exchanges of information and expertise are created by astronaut reunions. Presentations are delivered to the general public at the annual Congress. The organization provides online accessible information with weekly interchange through the ASE downlinks. Member/Astronaut appearances at schools and other public forums provide a platform for promoting the benefits of space science and exploration.##The organization participates in numerous educational activities designed to educate and inspire future generations around the benefits of space science, exploration and international cooperation.A key component of ASE's mission is to enable and grow a technically knowledgeable and proficient future workforce, which is part of a national education imperative to ensure our nation's future economic and scientific prosperity. As part of ASE's general outreach efforts, our astronaut and cosmonaut members visit schools, universities and youth groups world-wide and interact with thousands of teachers, parents and students each year. ASE continuously explores creative ways to engage and inspire the next generation of scientists, astronauts and engineers.In 2016, ASE-USA continued its partnership with Ardusat, Inc. and Northrop Grumman Corporation to provide exciting and unique opportunities for high-school aged teams to conduct their own real research experiment in Earth orbit on board a real satellite. Participants engage with focused online course content, and design and build their own programs to monitor any of the 20 sensors onboard, using a variety of real-time, online resources. This unique program is intended to drive students toward Science/Technology/Engineering/Math (STEM) education and careers and to give them hands on, project-based learning experience in multiple formats - in the classroom, through independent study, or via science clubs and other after-school activities. ASE-USA spent $15,300 to support teams from across the USA, who were selected to prepare and fly space experiments. At each Planetary Congress, ASE members dedicate a full day for outreach with the local and national communities in the country where the Congress is being hosted. The astronauts and cosmonauts reach thousands of students, teachers, parents, and members of the general public to inspire and promote education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. ASE-USA member astronauts also engage with students and teachers throughout the year in the USA with school and university visits and lectures, as well as via partnerships with other educational organizations.##Planet Stewardship. ASE provides members opportunities to communicate their unique perspective of Earth to help stimulate humanity's sense of responsibility for the future of our planet. Among ASE's premier activities in the area of environmental education is the partnership in the development and deployment of the on-orbit astronaut earth photography tool Windows on Earth. ASE also is a driving force in promoting international planning for Near Earth Objects (NEO) deflections and works with the United Nations to implement ASE NEO recommendations.

Industry experts presented programs on rose care products.and fertilizers. Consulting and Master rosarians from the Houston Rose Society, the Texas Rose Rustlers and the American Rose Society presented programs on pruning and rose hybridization. In addition to featured speakers, the Society's continued its Grand Prix program (March November) that encouraged members to bring blooms from their gardens as a way to demonstrate cultivar varieties to the gardening public and Society members.HRS Board Members, Consulting and Master Rosarian members have given in excess of 20 programs on rose horticulture (in addition to the Society-presented monthly lectures) to (1) national horticulture events, (2) other local rose societies, (3) local, state and/or national garden clubs, (4) Master Gardener organizations, (5) customers at nursery-sponsored events, and (6) visitors to the American Rose Center and at other rose society gatherings at cities in Texas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Florida, and New York. Board members have also published a number of rose horticulture podcasts in collaboration with local plant nurseries.The Societys liaison with the Texas AgriLife Extension Service (part of Texas A&M University) presented a National Earth-Kind Outreach Program to students at the Texas A&M Landscape Architect School, educating the students on the Societys work with the university to develop environmentally sound landscape management practices for roses.Educational Activities: The Society hosted a community pruning demonstration, a rose show and spring garden tours that were open to the general public and members at no charge. Additionally, the Society supported the American Rose Society Fall National Convention held in Syracuse, New York which was attended by many of the Societys members and members of the Board of Directors presented educational programs at this national event.##Public Outreach: The Society created, maintains and/or has supposed public rose plantings in Texas and Louisiana, including two gardens at the American Rose Center in Shreveport, Louisiana and rose plantings at the University of Texas Medical Branch - MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. Society members also consulted with landscape designers regarding the renovation of the Houston Municipal Rose Garden. In addition, HRS Board Members (as well as some members) help maintain public rose plantings at several churches and schools in Harris and Dallas counties in Texas.The Society also sponsors and maintains a rose trial garden as part of a partnership with the Harris County Texas AgriLife Extension Service and a local hospital district. This plant trial will demonstrate to the public cultivars that can be maintained with no chemical inputs and reduced irrigation.Our Consulting and Master Rosarian members participated in local radio station gardening shows answering call-in questions on rose growing in the Houston area. Many of the Societys Consulting and Master Rosarians are also part of the American Rose Societys Cyber CR program answering questions about local rose care posed by gardeners around the country.Part of the Societys public outreach comes from its affiliation and partnership with local nurseries. Through these affiliations, the Society was able to host a rose festival, a rose propagation clinic, and a number of pruning demonstrations at area nurseries throughout the year.Research and Education: The Houston Rose Society is the financial underwriter of the Earth-Kind Environmental Rose Research Program conducted by the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service. As part of this research effort, the Society had 400 rose bushes under evaluation in a public planting in Farmers Branch, Texas and in Commerce, Texas in these multi-year studies. The Society also sponsors a rose research trial at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas and the trial site was open to the public for educational tours in the spring of 2014. The horticulture research efforts sponsored by the Society have thus far yielded publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals, a book chapter in a peer-reviewed horticulture textbook, a research presentation to the Southern Nursery Association Research Conference and many industry and trade journals in addition to publication in the public media. The public demand and interest in environmentally responsible rose horticulture has allowed this research effort to be expanded to currently include 8 universities in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, New York, Louisiana and Arkansas and public gardens in Texas, New York, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska.In 2014, the Board created a Horticultural Scholarship Program that provides an annual scholarship to deserving students of horticulture.

Our goal is to enrich the lives of Americas homeless by providing clean bottled water, delivered with a daily, inspirational message of hope, and love.","Water Program: The I Am Waters Foundation provides physical and spiritual hydration to America's homeless through our designated shelter partners and homeless service care providers. Since 2010, we have delivered 4,174,209 branded bottles of water with words of inspiration and encouragement inscribed on them, such as Hope, Love, Peace and Dream, throughout Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Arkansas. All bottles are rPet bottles that are 100% recyclable.##I Am Jobs by I Am Waters: A study was conducted in 2016, ""When Water Meets a Higher Need: A Study of an Unprecedented Mission,"" in order to assess the impact and efficacy of IAW's program. The water and the word are invitations to initiate a conversation within themselves to begin the process of reintegration into society and improve their quality of life. When a person is ready, job placement becomes a crucial step to ending homelessness and beginning self-sufficiency. There is a hot-line for the homeless to call when they are ready to work. IAW staff then assesses the individual and enters them in the Airtable database and assists the candidate with a resume if needed. IAW staff is developing corporate relationships for job opportunities for the candidates. The I Am Jobs program also includes mentoring through the process of obtaining and keeping a job. The goal is for the candidate to gain meaningful employment for at least a year and then be a mentor in the program themselves.##Face of the American Homeless (Image Campaign): The Face of the American Homeless program has been established to bring a face to who the American homeless are. I Am Waters discovered that a highly productive and meaningful way to engage with the homeless community and create a dialogue was to organize a photo-shoot at the various shelters. With the help of a professional photographer, we captured the images of dozens of homeless and used these images as a way to talk with them about their current situation. We pair the images with statistics about the homeless.","Provide fresh, clean water to the homeless.",2.018208293493005e+17,15249171.0,990,4/6/2018 8:22:31 AM,I AM WATERS FOUNDATION INC,201710.0,2018.0,2017.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several programs utilize trained citizen scientists to augment professional monitoring data and aid in watershed planning. In 2016, GBFs Volunteer Water Monitoring Team was represented (at year-end) by 57 volunteers who sampled from 59 sites. GBF continued to contribute our water quality data to the Citizen Science Data Portal, a part of the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Ocean Observing System (GCOOS). We also trained 15 citizen monitors for the new Bottlenose Dolphin Field Research Assistant program and utilized their services on seven boat-based dolphin surveys in Upper Galveston Bay conducted by program partner, Environmental Institute of Houston. GBF continued to be actively engaged in discussion and planning on improving coastal resiliency and to advocate for the allocation of research dollars to the region to ensure the health of Galveston Bay and its users.",The Galveston Bay Foundation works to ensure a clean and healthy Galveston Bay that can be enjoyed by people today and for generations to come. Our diverse programs preserve and protect Texas largest and most productive estuary.,"GBFs conservation programs focus on estuarine habitat preservation, protection, and restoration. Continuing our work as a nationally accredited land trust, GBF acquired over 140 acres of new fee simple conservation properties in 2016, including 102 acres along Chocolate Bayou in Brazoria County, 8.55 acres adjacent to our Sweetwater Nature Preserve in Galveston County, and 29.96 acres in Kemah in Galveston County that will be restored as a habitat demonstration area and opened to the public as part of the future Galveston Bay Education Center and headquarters for GBF. We also acquired a conservation easement on a 216-acre Coastal Heritage Preserve tract in Galveston County and hosted the Grand Opening and Ribbon Cutting Ceremony at another property on which we hold a conservation easement, the Turtle Bayou Nature Preserve in Chambers County. GBF also worked extensively in 2016 to restore degraded habitats around Galveston Bay. We coordinated the restoration of 70 acres of intertidal marsh by partnering with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Natural Resources Damage Assessment Trustees to beneficially use material dredged from the GIWW to restore wetland habitat; constructed and planted 33 marsh mounds as part of phase 2 of the Burnet Bay Wetlands Restoration project; completed two living shorelines projects with private landowners and hosted a living shorelines workshop for contractors, agency partners, and homeowners; planted 132 trees at locations including Rich Sanctuary and Turtle Bayou Nature Preserve in Chambers County and Sweetwater Preserve in Galveston County; and planted one acre of intertidal marsh at the Shipe Woods project site and 1.5 acres at the Oyster Lake project site. We welcomed a new restaurantTookies Seafoodto our Galveston Bay Oyster Shell Recycling Program and continued collecting shells from Tommys Restaurant and Oyster Bar, Topwater Grill, the Kemah Boardwalk, Crazy Alans Swamp Shack, and Captain Bennys Seafood, reclaiming 168 tons of shells, a 28% increase from the previous year. Utilizing some of this reclaimed oyster shell, we constructed approximately 200 feet of oyster bars within Sweetwater Lake with assistance from 128 volunteers during eight volunteer workdays and gardened oysters with the assistance of over 60 volunteers who deployed 7,800 oyster shells, 30% of which contained newly grown spat, on existing restoration reefs in Kemah, San Leon, and Galveston. GBF also hosted numerous community-based habitat enhancement events including TPWDs annual Abandoned Crab Trap Removal event at the Fort Anahuac Park site, in which we removed 268 crab traps from Trinity Bay with the assistance of 85 volunteers and 10 boats; a River, Lakes, Bays, N Bayous Trash Bash event at Bay Area Park, in which 585 volunteers collected an estimated 1.1 tons of trash, recyclables, and compostable materials as well as 49 tires from the Armand Bayou watershed; a trash cleanup site with the Port of Houston Authority at Morgans Point as part of the Texas Adopt-A-Beach Cleanup program, in which 84 volunteers collected 1,800 pounds of trash and 1,000 pounds of recyclable materials from a 1.3-mile stretch of shoreline; and marsh grass planting events, including Marsh Mania events in the fall and spring, at Beach City, Anahuac, Dickinson, and Brazoria County involving 121 volunteers in planting 4.09 acres of estuarine intertidal marsh.##GBFs education programs allowed us to reach thousands of youth and adults in 2016, with events and campaigns aimed at increasing the publics awareness of the importance of Galveston Bay as well as more structured programs that provide science-based environmental education focused on Galveston Bay. We hosted the tenth annual Bike Around the Bay sponsored by Shell, which allowed us to bring our message to more than 1,460 registered cyclists and over 300 volunteers and expose them to the beauty of the Bay. We also hosted the Bay Day Festival at the Kemah Boardwalk, with 35 educational exhibits, support from 87 volunteers, and an estimated attendance of over 4,800 visitors. We concluded the 2015-16 Get Hip to Habitat year by serving 1,500 students at 19 schools and kicked off the 2016-17 school year with participation by 15 schools. We delivered Bay Ambassador presentations to 2,000 students and professional development training workshops and resources to 30 educators. GBF also hosted nine Rain Barrel Workshops and delivered 489 rain barrels and kits into local communities, potentially reducing 546,450 gallons of stormwater runoff from reaching Galveston Bay and improving water conservation within our watershed. We continued our outreach efforts on the Cease the Grease campaign with over 15 participating partners and established a cooking oil recycling station in partnership with the City of Nassau Bay.##GBFs advocacy program attempts to balance the multiple uses of Galveston Bay so that the long-term interests of the Bay itself are not compromised. In 2016, we engaged in dialogue with local staff of our U.S. and State representatives and senators on a variety of Galveston Bay issues including San Jacinto River Waste Pits, storm surge mitigation, seafood consumption safety, closure of Rollover Pass, and the Clean Waters Rule (Waters of the U.S.). Of critical importance, we advocated for removal of the dioxin wastes at the San Jacinto River Waste Pits in Channelview by providing official comments to EPA and educating and rallying local community members, recreational fishermen, commercial fishermen, and all eight local U.S. congressmen to support the call for removal. GBF also began meeting with local stakeholders to discuss the No Discharge Zone initiative for Galveston Bay. In partnership with the Houston Advanced Research Center, GBF released the second annual Galveston Bay Report Card in 2016, with the Bay earning an overall grade of C, and continued our efforts to spread the message on how the Galveston Bay community can work to improve this grade. Through our partnership with Texas Living Waters, we helped to launch the Texas Water Conservation Scorecard, an analysis that ranks 306 Texas water utilities according to their water conservation efforts. We also launched the Galveston Bay Water Brigade, a campaign designed to raise awareness of the effect of water conservation on environmental flows and freshwater inflows for Galveston Bay, and partnered with City of Houstons Sustainability Office to include it as part of the 2016 City of Houston Green Office Challenge. We also engaged Hispanic community leaders and citizens in water-related issues through the event Strengthening Alliances for our Regions Water Future and the newly created Facebook page ATH: Agua Para Todos Houston. GBF began development of a downloadable mobile app for the Galveston Bay Action Network pollution reporting tool that allows the public to report pollution around the Bay and automatically forwards those reports to one of eleven authorities in charge of response/enforcement. Our volunteer Wetland Permit Review Committeeactive for a consecutive 27 yearsreviewed 28 applications for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permits and provided letters of concern or comments on 7 of them.","The mission of the Galveston Bay Foundation is to preserve, protect, and enhance the natural resources of the Galveston Bay estuarine system and its tributaries for present users and for posterity.",2.0183017934930083e+17,15207071.0,990,3/7/2018 8:31:27 PM,GALVESTON BAY FOUNDATION INC,201612.0,2018.0,2016.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Responsibilities include maintaining and cleaning the Parks grounds, water features, and hardscapes; planting and watering trees; and weeding. The Conservancy manages the maintenance program for the 15-acre McGovern Centennial Gardens. Conservancy maintenance workers keep the gardens in top condition, ensuring that the gardens are well tended through each season. The Cherie Flores Garden Pavilion and Celebration Garden, McGovern Centennial Gardens rental venues, are available to host private events in an elegant urban garden setting. The volunteer program supports the McGovern Centennial Gardens staff as well as lending a hand throughout the Park. Volunteers are involved with Park maintenance, horticulture and reforestation efforts and create a connection between the Park and the community.##Visitor ServicesThe Visitor Services department was developed in 2008 when Hermann Park Conservancy was awarded the contract by the City of Houston to manage the Hermann Park Railroad. Visitor Services oversees and operates the train, pedal boats, and Pinewood Cafe, and coordinates activities with the Conservancy Gift Shop and food vendors throughout the Park. The department hosts special programs at Lake Plaza including a yearly birthday party for Park namesake, George Hermann, the holiday train, a festive holiday party with arts and crafts and other activities, holiday brunches at Pinewood Cafe and student performances. Approximately 40 staff members are responsible for creating an exciting and memorable experience for Park visitors and keeping Lake Plaza operating efficiently and safely. The maintenance team is responsible for the cleaning and upkeep of Lake Plaza.##Planning, Design and Construction The Conservancy identified underdeveloped areas of the Park that could be developed into more visitor-friendly landscapes and brought prominent landscape architecture firm, Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, on board to study the Park's needs and develop an updated master plan to guide improvements for the next 20 years. The Conservancy and the City of Houston collaborated on a restoration project in the Japanese Garden ahead of the garden's 25th anniversary in 2017. The restoration project included structural improvements as well as a new dry-stream garden. Architecture firm Curtis & Windham moved forward with the next phase of restoration of Hermann Park's historic clubhouse, built in 1933.

To meet the demands of this new management agreement, the Conservancy incurred large start-up costs to purchase equipment, materials, and supplies and to nearly double staff and contractors. Park management software was purchased to improve staff efficiency, customer service and to track productivity; a new cloud based document retention system and an electronic timekeeping system were part of additional technological improvements. Special projects included resurfacing trails, updating signage, maps, and entrances throughout the Park, repairing damage after two unusual flood events, increasing mowing from every 21 days to every 7-14 days, daily clearing and de-littering of ADA ramps and high-use parking lots, and daily restroom and sanitation services. The Conservancy also has arobust internship and research program for studying the diverse aspects of managing, improving and maintaining a forested urban park. In addition to this work, more than 3,000 volunteer hours were contributed toward the rehabilitation and beautification of the Park, all while working alongside professional staff and vocational horticulturists such as Master Naturalists and Master Gardeners.##See Schedule OEcological Restoration: This year's ecological restoration and conservation program included convening an Eco-Tech panel of area experts that met frequently throughout the year to address and find solutions for ecological issues within the Park. The Conservancy treated approximately 190 acres for invasive species to prepare for the ecological restoration projects identified in the Memorial Park Master Plan. Two thousand trees were planted as part of ecological restoration work for the Eastern Glades project in partnership with Trees for Houston. The Conservancy finalized an in-depth tree inventory to build on existing landscaped areas inventory and provided habitat assessment in select locations. In conjunction with this, a biological assessment was initiated to identify and inventory all living creatures in the Park (insects, animals, and plants). As part of an ongoing fuels management program, over 140 acres were treated for hazardous fuels reduction including the removal of 900 hazard trees. Over 1,000 stumps were ground as part of ongoing park care. A native meadow grass demonstration garden was installed to inform the success of future projects. In addition to ecological care of the natural environment, sensitive maintenance was the focus of the Conservancy's volunteer and community outreach program.##See Schedule OCapital Improvements: The Conservancy, in partnership with the Uptown Houston Tax Reinvestment Zone #17, implemented capital improvements as part of the Master Plan. All Master Plan Phase 1 projects were developed through conceptual design. The first Master Plan project, the Eastern Glades, broke ground. Project planning and design work progressed including archeological studies for Memorial Groves; preparation of construction drawings for Phase 1 of Eastern Glades; and schematic design work for the Park's Hogg Bird Sanctuary led by partnering organization Houston Parks Board. MPC supported the installation of a 12"" water line and the final phase of resurfacing the popular exercise trail in the Park. As part of advancing future capital improvements to the Park, a capital campaign was launched and raised over $10M in pledges at the end of the fiscal year.","Memorial Park Conservancy (MPC) is dedicated to the preservation and enhancement of Memorial Park for today and for future generations; to public use, enjoyment and education in accordance with conditions of the conveyance to the City of Houston.",2.0182106934930125e+17,15289578.0,990,5/4/2018 9:43:05 PM,MEMORIAL PARK CONSERVANCY INC,201705.0,2018.0,2017.0,5.0,7575 N PICNIC,26290646.0,1939810.0,core2014pc,HOUSTON,201505.0,1518538.0,,Y,48201.0,,15.0,10.0,,9373467.0,,PC,S,ZA,C,C,3362.0,813219.0,MEMORIAL PARK CONSERVANCY INC,C,C113,,C1130,,EN,EN,OT,IN,,,3360.0,0.11205426763852787,200010.0,,,TX,3.0,201705.0,2018.0,N,77007.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sanctuaries are managed with a focus on habitat restoration, invasive species control, bird monitoring and protection, and providing public access to inspiring natural experiences. Last year the HAS Natives Nursery was upgraded to increase the plant-growing capacity for local bird-friendly community-based projects and for regional partners working to increase pollinator habitats. In 2016 HAS applied for and subsequently was awarded accreditation under the national program for land trusts, demonstrating its commitment to quality standards for protecting natural places and a sound program of land stewardship.##EDUCATION & OUTREACH: Last year HAS provided 979 unique natural science programs to over 47,000 children and adults at its two urban nature centers and through its extensive programming throughout the Houston-Galveston area. Program offerings include nature camps, outreach programs to schools and community groups, onsite workshops and tours, naturalist-led field trips, and citizen science bird surveys and watch events. HAS also sponsors regular speaker programs, publishes a bi-monthly newsletter, and hosts an informative website covering topics of interest to birders and nature enthusiasts. In 2016 the HAS website was redesigned to better accommodate mobile platforms and to incorporate a Bird Friendly Houston component, with the goal of transforming Houston into a city that celebrates birds and values natural spaces.",The vision of Houston Audubon Society (HAS) is a healthier natural environment and a more beautiful place to live created by leading and nurturing a community that values and supports birds.,2.0180130934930406e+17,15646269.0,990,8/31/2018 6:23:16 PM,HOUSTON AUDUBON SOCIETY INC,201706.0,2018.0,2017.0,6.0,440 WILCHESTER BLVD,7745221.0,7095240.0,16eofinextract990.dat,HOUSTON,201506.0,1370346.0,,Y,48201.0,,16.0,10.0,,1920590.0,,PC,O,EN,C,C,3362.0,813312.0,HOUSTON AUDUBON SOCIETY,C,C30,,C30,,EN,EN,OT,IN,,,3360.0,0.4802841559779471,197001.0,,,TX,3.0,201706.0,2018.0,N,77079.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Click here for more detailed information about the bathhouse, including the preservation and restoration plans for the Historic Deep Eddy Bathhouse, prepared by Limbacher & Godfrey Architects for the Friends of Deep Eddy. Designating the pool as a historic landmark We are pleased to announce that the application for placing Deep Eddy on the National Register of Historic Places has been officially approved by the National Park Service. Thanks again to Hannah Swenson for all the hard work she did on the application. Landscape Improvement The FODE has been working with the city to develop a longe range plan to improve the landscaping around Deep Eddy. Our primary concern has been the loss of the 90 year old cottonwoods which surround the park. Additionally we are working with the city to install a permanent irrigation system to keep the grass green during the summer in high traffic areas within the park.","The Friends of Deep Eddy is a non-profit organization made up of individuals who devote their time and resources to protecting and improving Deep Eddy and it's facilities.

In addition to tours highlighting the history and architecture of this unique industrial site, BBP presents periodic art installations in the space. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 7: Land Acquisition - BBP has an ongoing land acquisition program for trails and facilities along both sides of Buffalo Bayou from Shepherd Drive to the Port of Houston turning basin. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 8: Hike and Bike Trails - A top priority of Buffalo Bayou Partnership is to build a continuous system of trails on the north and south banks of Buffalo Bayou from Shepherd Drive to the Turning Basin. This will give Houstonians and visitors 20 miles of trails to run, walk and bike along our waterway. To accommodate residents and visitors who want to enjoy a walk or jog along the Shepherd Drive to Sabine Street stretch of the bayou, BBP added asphalt footpaths closer to the waterway.","Buffalo Bayou Partnership (""BBP"") is transforming and revitalizing Buffalo Bayou, Houstons most significant natural resource.

The project involved flood management, eco-restoration, new hike and bike trails and an array of park amenities. The park improvements were substantially completed for the Buffalo Bayou Park project in 2015, and BBP transferred ownership to the City. BBP maintains and operates the 160-acre Buffalo Bayou Park and is also responsible for maintaining the hike and bike trails and green spaces along the waterway from Sabine to Fannin streets. To assist with ongoing maintenance and conservation efforts, BBP relies on thousands of volunteers and community service workers each year that remove weeds and invasive species, plant wildflowers, pick up trash and remove silt from the trails after heavy rains.##Buffalo Bayou Partnership Special Events - BBP offers a wide-range of recreational and cultural activities, including:Buffalo Bayou Partnership Regatta - Annual 15-mile canoe and kayak race on Buffalo Bayou from Voss Road to Sesquicentennial Park in Downtown Houston, held in March.Kids Day - A free event filled with family fun, educational activities, music, food, dazzling park performers, and bayou boat rides, held annually in October.

Currently, over 900 acres are actively managed within our preserve boundaries. Critical prairie habitat is annually being restored and then preserved through controlled burns and mowing to reduce invasive species and replanting native grasses and forbs propagated in our native plant nursery. More recently, ABNC has assumed management of a 24-acre tract that specifically protects the endangered Prairie Dawn Flower species. Additionally, ABNC manages over 330 acres of Texas State Coastal Preserve in the Armand Bayou watershed, restoring intertidal marsh to maintain appropriate water depth and encourage native plant and animal recolonization.##Education: Over 9,500 students of all ages participate in ABNC environmental education programs annually. School groups attend Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) correlated outdoor classes, field trips, and unique natural and cultural history programs. ABNC offers outdoor nature camps each summer and winter, scouting and similar youth programs, and community outreaches. ABNC has also introduced a range of early-childhood outdoor programs and STEM focused classes to support home school programs.##Visitor Services: Over 20,000 guests visit ABNC annually, another 2,000 member visits are also recorded. Almost 2,500 people travel to ABNC to attend meetings and private events each year. Visitors follow the self-guided accessible Discovery Trail interpretive loop to habitat overlooks, interpretive exhibits and historical farm displays; others venture out on over 5 miles of developed hiking trails. Volunteers help ABNC conduct numerous interpretive activities, including guided trail hikes, animal demonstrations, hands-on-history craft demonstrations, and guided canoe and pontoon boat tours of Armand Bayou. ABNC special places are also available for family retreats, company meetings and seasonal parties. Several community groups utilize ABNC meeting spaces, and ABNC regularly hosts nature-related conferences.",To preserve the habitats with which we have been entrusted and to provide opportunities for people to experience and understand the local ecosystems.

REEFS WILL ATTRACT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FISH, BUT MORE ARE ABLE TO GROW IF A SITE INCLUDES A SMALL REEF FOR SMALLER FISH, A MID-SIZED REEF FOR MID-SIZED FISH AND A LARGE REEF FOR LARGER FISH. THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY REEF UTILIZES VARIOUS MATERIALS TO CATER TO DIFFERENT SPECIES, SUCH AS CINDER BLOCKS, LARGE CONCRETE PYRAMIDS AND SUNKEN SHRIMP BOATS. A RECENT PHASE OF THE REEF WILL SEE THE DEVELOPMENT OF 60,000-240,000 RED SNAPPER PER YEAR, WITH 50 PERCENT REMAINING IN THE GULF. THIS GROWTH WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON THE LOCAL ECONOMY AND BUSINESSES. STUDIES ARE CONTINUOUSLY BEING ADMINISTERED ON EFFICIENCY AND EFFICACY OF THE GROWING REEF BY THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS RIO GRANDE VALLEY AND TEXAS A&M GALVESTON. DR. RICK KLINE OF UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS RIO GRANDE VALLEY PRESENTED A PAPER ON THE SITE'S FIRST TEST CINDER BLOCK NURSERY REEF AT THE AMERICAN FISHERIES CONFERENCE. DR. JAY ROOKER AND HIS RESEARCHERS FROM TEXAS A&M GALVESTON RECENTLY COUNTED 1,700 IMMEDIATE POST-SETTLEMENT JUVENILE RED SNAPPER ON ONE OF THE SITE'S 300 NURSERY PATCHES THAT ARE LESS THAN 30 DAYS OLD. THESE STUDIES ARE BOLSTERING FISH POPULATIONS THROUGH IMPROVED MANAGEMENT AND DATA COLLECTION. A CURRENT STUDY ON LOCAL DEMOGRAPHICS AND THOSE SERVED BY THE REEF IS CURRENTLY BEING CONDUCTED AS WELL. WIDE SUPPORT FROM THE COMMUNITY AND LOCAL UNIVERSITIES ENSURES THAT PERFORMANCE METRICS WILL CONTINUE AT THIS SITE. THE LONG-TERM VISION OF THE RGV REEF IS TO HAVE LOW RELIEF MATERIALS IN THE REEF SITE FOR THE SMALL MARINE LIFE AND FISH, AND HIGHER RELIEF MATERIALS, SUCH AS PRE-CONSTRUCTED PYRAMIDS, FOR HIGHER RELIEF HABITAT AND LARGER FISH, THUS CREATING A ""LIFE-CYCLE"" REEF.

Our programs focus on four major areas; Wetland Ecology, Plant Ecology, Bird Adaptations and Water Conservation. Our programming is specifically marketed to Dallas ISD and 13 member cities and numerous independent school districts that the North Texas Municipal Water District serves. Each program is geared toward the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills giving students hands on experience in conducting field research and applying it to school-based studies. The programs also assist teachers in using the Wetland as a demonstration model of how humans may have a positive impact on the environment. We believe this method helps students make sound environmental decisions and provides a frame of reference when choosing a science-based career path. Our programs are continually developed and improving using external review and input from teachers and researchers alike.In 2017 the JBS Wetland Center offered 30 adult programs attracting 2,744 adults. Our adult programs focus on regional environmental topics pertaining to water reuse and supply, wildlife species, the state of water in Texas, and how to create and maintain sound conservation decisions around the home or workplace.","The mission of the John Bunker Sands Wetland Center is to educate and provide research opportunities in the areas of water reuse, quality, supply; wildlife conservation; and wetland systems.",2.018421893493006e+17,15736722.0,990,9/27/2018 1:14:47 PM,JOHN BUNKER SANDS WETLAND CENTER INC,201712.0,2018.0,2017.0,12.0,2101 CEDAR SPRINGS RD STE 1600,1918070.0,1931275.0,16eofinextract990.dat,DALLAS,201512.0,309539.0,,Y,48113.0,,15.0,10.0,,623952.0,,PC,O,EN,C,C,1922.0,813312.0,JOHN BUNKER SANDS WETLAND CENTER,C,C32,,C32,,EN,EN,OT,IN,,,1920.0,0.9399858899031838,201008.0,,,TX,3.0,201712.0,2018.0,N,75201.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

93493225002368.0,260161807,EFILE,,,,,,"To conserve the Texas heritage of agricultural lands, natural resources and wildlife habitats.","Outreach: TALT's outreach work falls into two categories: to educate landowners and their advisors on how to use conservation easements to protect, conserve and pass land down to future generations; and to educate the general public about the benefits private working lands provide - such as clean and plentiful drinking water, domestic and affordable food and fiber, and wildlife habitat - and the need to protect those lands for the benefit of all Texans. Education and outreach programs occur in a wide variety of formats and reach diverse audiences. During the tax year, some of TALT's outreach efforts included: landowner workshops in Victoria, Bay City and Austin; sponsorship and attendance at the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Ranch Gatherings across the state; hosting information booths at the Texas Wildlife Association annual convention, TSSWCB, Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Annual Conventions, Texas Chapter of The Wildlife Society annual meeting, South Texas Property Rights Association annual meeting; Trans-Pecos Wildlife Conference, and the Texas Grazing Land Coalition Workshop. In addition, TALT celebrated its 10th Anniversary in March of 2018 with a fundraising celebration in Victoria, TX. One hundred and twenty local landowners and statewide supporters attended the event to celebrate 10 years of conservation of working lands. TALTs anniversary was also commemorated through Texas Senate Proclamation 312 commending TALT for preserving the states agricultural lands.Through the use of its newsletter, social media and speaking engagements, TALT educates an urban audience regarding the public benefits of rural working lands. TALT staff and board members additionally penned several opinion editorials that were published in major Texas newspapers highlighting the values of private working lands, as they relate to current events.##Conservation easements to protect working lands: TALT partners with landowners who seek donated conservation easements, purchase of development rights, and mitigation banking conservation easements. TALT staff provides professional, efficient, responsive and experienced service for the negotiations of conservation easements. TALT will then monitor and steward these easements on an annual basis. TALT's processes have been developed over the past eleven years and incorporate best management practices from the Land Trust Alliance (LTA) and from members of the Partnership of Rangeland Trusts (PORT). At the end of the tax year, TALT held conservation easements on over 226,000 acres of Texas farms and ranches throughout the state. TALT today is the largest state-based land trust in Texas and numbers among in the top 15 regional or state wide land trusts in the country according to a recent LTA census.","The mission of the Texas Agricultural Land Trust (TALT) is to conserve the Texas heritage of agricultural lands, natural resources and wildlife habitats. TALT works to sustain the long-term stewardship of private lands for the benefit of all Texans. TALT accomplishes its mission through the use of voluntary conservation measures and through education and outreach efforts. TALT partners with private landowners to negotiate and transact conservation easements that protect important conservation values, in accordance with IRC Section 170(h).

KPC also monitors its conservation easement lands on an annual basis to ensure that the goals and objectives of the legal agreement between KPC and the impacted landowner are followed and the land in question remains viable for its conservation values. KPC is working to establish more vigorous baseline data on all its preserves and to tract changes over time through regular monitoring protocols. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 5: Land Management and Restoration - During 2004-2005, KPC's Board of Directors approved securing a majority ownership of the historic Warren Ranch, a working cattle ranch. The Board determined that the continued operations of the Warren Ranch were part of KPC's mission to protect the unique scenic, historic and natural sites on the Katy Prairie. They noted that well-managed farmland shelters wildlife, supplies scenic open space, and helps filter impurities from our air and water and that these agricultural lands offer many other benefits as well: preservation of open space and natural resources; outdoor recreation, including bird watching, hiking, hunting, and nature tours; improved flood protection; economic development through eco-tourism; enhanced wildlife habitat; recharge zones for the area's aquifers; educational field trips for area youth, and research opportunities for colleges and universities in ecology and land management. The prairie also provides children who might not otherwise have an opportunity to visit a working ranch to ride a horse or tour a farm to see how food is produced - a distinctive outdoor experience.","Long-term goals are to: protect 50,000 acres; allow public access; ensure responsible stewardship of protected lands; restore and enhance wildlife habitat; offer educational programs; and conduct and facilitate appropriate research to accomplish KPCs mission.","Land Conservation - The Katy Prairie Conservancy (KPC) protects land on the Katy Prairie in the following ways: acquisition of conservation lands at fair market value, acquisition of conservation lands through a bargain sale arrangement, receipt of donated conservation lands to KPC, receipt of donated trade lands to KPC, donation of conservation easements to KPC, and purchase of development rights on conservation lands on the Katy Prairie. Conservation lands are held in permanent trust and are maintained for the benefit of both the wildlife that inhabit the lands and the public who enjoy visiting KPC's preserves.##Preserve Enhancement - KPC has developed general management plans for all its protected properties that ensure that the lands are not further degraded by invasive species (including Chinese Tallow, McCartney Rose, feral hogs and other feral animals) and are maintained in their traditional uses. More detailed management plans are prepared for properties as KPC undertakes preserve enhancement and restoration activities, including the restoration and creation of wetlands and the enhancement and replanting of native grasslands.##Land Management and Restoration - During 2004-2005, KPC's Board of Directors approved securing a majority ownership of the historic Warren Ranch, a working cattle ranch. The Board determined that the continued operations of the Warren Ranch were part of KPC's mission to protect the unique scenic, historic and natural sites on the Katy Prairie. They noted that well-managed farmland shelters wildlife, supplies scenic open space, and helps filter impurities from our air and water and that these agricultural lands offer many other benefits as well: preservation of open space and natural resources; outdoor recreation, including bird watching, hiking, hunting, and nature tours; improved flood protection; economic development through eco-tourism; enhanced wildlife habitat; recharge zones for the area's aquifers; educational field trips for area youth, and research opportunities for colleges and universities in ecology and land management.

UNDER YOUR FEET CAMPAIGN - MUCH OF THE RECENT GROWTH IN BEXAR COUNTY HAS TAKEN PLACE OVER THE RECHARGE AND CONTRIBUTING ZONES OF THE EDWARDS AQUIFER, RESULTING IN A TREND OF INCREASED CONTAMINATION OF OUR WATER SUPPLIES AND SPRING FLOWS. AREA HOMEOWNERS MUST BE EDUCATED ABOUT THE GEOLOGY OF THE EDWARDS AQUIFER AND HOW TO LIVE IN THIS EXTREMELY ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREA. A SUITE OF PRESENTATIONS, ON-LINE RESOURCES, SOCIAL MEDIA, AND PRINT MATERIALS WILL TEACH THEM ABOUT ACTIONS THEY CAN TAKE TO PROTECT OUR AQUIFER, INCLUDING HOW TO HANDLE AND STORE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS, WHAT COMMON HOUSEHOLD PRACTICES POSE A THREAT TO THE INTEGRITY OF SEWAGE SYSTEMS, AND HOW TO PLANT AND MAINTAIN LANDSCAPING IN THIS UNIQUE REGION. MODELED ON THE SUCCESSFUL ""UNDER YOUR FEET"" CAMPAIGNS IN KENTUCKY AND FLORIDA, GEAA IS WORKING WITH THE CREATORS OF THESE PROGRAMS TO ADAPT THEM TO THE EDWARDS REGION. COMMUNITY RAIN GARDENS PROJECT - GEAA IS WORKING WITH HOME OWNERS' ASSOCIATIONS TO CREATE COMMUNITY RAIN GARDENS. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM GEAA WILL NEIGHBORHOODS TO INSTALL LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID) PROJECTS SUCH AS SWALES, RAIN GARDENS, AND SPECIFIC PLANTINGS TO ENHANCE FILTRATION OF STORMWATER BEFORE IT ENTERS THE AQUIFER. LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS WITH EXPERTISE IN LID WILL BE EMPLOYED TO DESIGN AND HELP HOMEOWNERS TO PROPERLY INSTALL AND MAINTAIN SITE SPECIFIC LID ENHANCEMENTS. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, WE HOPE TO EDUCATE HOMEOWNERS ON THE EDWARDS AQUIFER RECHARGE ZONE HOW TO IDENTIFY AND REPORT NON-COMPLIANT SYSTEMS, TO ENHANCE THE FUNCTION OF THE SYSTEMS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS, AND TO GENERALLY EDUCATE THEM ON THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING THE EDWARDS AQUIFER. CONSENSUS BUILDING GEAA REPRESENTS THE CONSENSUS POSITIONS OF OUR MEMBER GROUPS IN MANY REGIONAL PROCESSES AND ADVISORY COMMITTEES CONVENED TO ADDRESS VARIOUS WATER ISSUES, INCLUDING THE EDWARDS AQUIFER RECOVERY IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM, BEXAR REGIONAL WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT GROUP, COMAL COUNTY STAKEHOLDERS GROUP, SA TOMORROW, AND OTHERS. EDUCATION PROGRAMS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC HOLDS IS THAT THE EDWARDS AQUIFER, LIKE MOST OTHER AQUIFERS, FILTERS WATER ENTERING ITS RESERVOIR THROUGH LAYERS OF SAND AND GRAVEL. THE EDWARDS, HOWEVER, IS A KARST AQUIFER. THE KARST LIMESTONE STRUCTURE OF THE EDWARDS AQUIFER ALLOWS FOR ONLY MINIMAL FILTRATION OF WATER ENTERING THE AQUIFER, MAKING IT VULNERABLE TO CONTAMINATION FROM URBAN RUNOFF ""NONPOINT SOURCE"" POLLUTION. TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC, GEAA HAS DESIGNED A COMPREHENSIVE CURRICULUM OF ACCURATE, UP-TO-DATE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION ON CAVE FORMATION AND THE CHEMISTRY, GEOLOGY, AND BIOLOGY OF KARST AQUIFERS. DURING 2013 GEAA PRESENTED 45 CLASSROOM DEMONSTRATIONS, LECTURES AND LABS AND 10 FIELD TRIPS TO GOVERNMENT CANYON STATE NATURAL AREA. ""TEACHERS IN-SERVICE PROGRAMS SERVE MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE TEACHERS OFSAN ANTONIO'S SEVENTEEN INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. FREE WORKSHOPS ON KARST GEOLOGY AND THE EDWARDS AQUIFER INCLUDE DEMONSTRATIONS OF LAB EXERCISES, PRESENTATIONS BY EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF KARST GEOLOGY AND A GUIDED TOUR OF A KARST RECHARGE CAVE. TEACHERS RECEIVE TEXAS ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS (TEKS) AND TEXAS ASSESSMENT OF KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS (TAKS) APPROPRIATE CURRICULA, MAPS AND AUDIOVISUAL PRESENTATIONS FOR USE IN THE CLASS ROOM, LAB EXERCISES, LECTURES AND HANDS- ON DEMONSTRATIONS ABOUT ALL ASPECTS OF KARST AQUIFERS, INCLUDING HUMAN IMPACT ON THE EDWARDS AQUIFER. ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY TEACHERS EACH YEAR EARN CONTINUING EDUCATION CREDIT BY PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROGRAM. OUR ANIMATED DVD/CD ROM ""INNER VIEW OF THE EDWARDS AQUIFER"", PRODUCED INPARTNERSHIP WITH KLRN TV, HAS BEEN WIDELY DISTRIBUTED TO AREA TEACHERS. THE DVD/CD ROM PRESENTS LESSONS FO##THE GREATER EDWARDS AQUIFER ALLIANCE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM PROVIDES OUR MEMBER GROUPS, GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND POLICY MAKERS, AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE WITH TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION THAT ADDRESSES ISSUES OF REGIONAL AND LOCAL CONCERN AS RELATED TO THE PRESERVATION OF THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF THE WATERS IN THE EDWARDS AQUIFER, ITS CONTRIBUTING WATERSHEDS, AND ITS INDIGENOUS PLANT AND ANIMAL SPECIES. CITIZENS, NEWS MEDIA, AND INCREASINGLY, ELECTED OFFICIALS AND PUBLIC AGENCIES RELY ON GEAA STAFF TO PROVIDE OR DIRECT THEM TO TECHNICAL EXPERTISE REGARDING THE MANAGEMENT AND PROTECTION OF THE EDWARDS AND TRINITY KARST AQUIFER FORMATIONS.

THE GEAA TECHNICAL TEAM, WITH THE HELP OF STUDENT INTERNS FROM TRINITY UNIVERSITY, TEXAS STATE UNIVERSITY, AND OUR LADY OF THE LAKE UNIVERSITY, IS CURRENTLY RESEARCHING THE IMPACT OF ON SITE SEWAGE FACILITIES (SEPTIC TANKS) VS CENTRALIZED SEWAGE SYSTEMS ON THE EDWARDS AQUIFER RECHARGE ZONE.
